# Specification Quality Checklist: JWT Pre-Authentication & Principal Profile Enrichment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-27  
**Feature**: [specs/016-jwt-preauth/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- 5 user stories with 19 acceptance scenarios covering: signed JWT auth, unsigned JWT auth, profile extraction, UI display, and backward compatibility.
- 20 functional requirements, 7 security requirements, 6 API requirements.
- 6 edge cases documented with expected behavior.
- Security requirements align with Constitution Principle I (Security-First) and Principle III (Library-First Security).
- Configuration design follows existing patterns from token_exchange.claim_extraction (CEL expressions per ADR 009).
