# Specification Quality Checklist: Dual-Port HTTP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED
**Date**: 2025-12-15

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written in business terms without implementation details. All sections use language accessible to non-technical stakeholders (system administrators, operations teams).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 16 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria use measurable metrics (5 seconds, 99%, 100% uptime). No clarification markers exist - reasonable defaults were used (e.g., default bind to 0.0.0.0, default graceful shutdown timeout of 30 seconds).

3. **Feature Readiness**: Four user stories are prioritized (P1-P3) with clear acceptance scenarios. Each story is independently testable and delivers incremental value.

## Notes

- Configuration suggestions are implicit in the requirements: YAML structure, environment variable naming conventions, and CLI flag naming follow existing patterns from the 002-flexible-configuration feature
- Assumption: Graceful shutdown timeout of 30 seconds is industry-standard for HTTP servers
- Assumption: Binding to 0.0.0.0 by default provides maximum compatibility for initial deployment
- Edge cases cover critical scenarios: port conflicts, privilege requirements, partial failures, invalid configurations
