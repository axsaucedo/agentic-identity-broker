# Tasks: RFC 8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/013-token-exchange/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), spec.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle VIII (Test-Driven Development & Automated Testing), automated tests are MANDATORY for all features. E2E acceptance tests are written in Phase 2f and MUST fail initially (red phase).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Summary

This feature implements RFC 8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange via the existing `/oauth2/token` endpoint. Key components:
- **JWKS Adapter**: lestrrat-go/jwx/v3 with jwk.Cache for caching
- **CEL Evaluator**: google/cel-go for authorization and claim extraction
- **Resource Discovery**: protected_resources field on ThirdpartyOAuth2Service
- **Grant Verification**: Ensures user has authorized agent access to service

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## 🔒 Phase 2: Design Preconditions (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Domain model, configuration, API, and database design MUST all be complete before implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No code implementation can begin until this entire phase is complete

### Phase 2a: Domain Model & Glossary [MANDATORY]

**Constitution Reference**: Principles II (Architecture Documentation), V (Domain-Driven Design & Glossary Management)

**Constitution Reference**: Principles IV (API Documentation & OpenAPI Transparency), X (API-First Development)

- [x] T007 Finalize token exchange endpoint contract in specs/013-token-exchange/contracts/token-exchange-endpoint.yaml (contracts/token-exchange-endpoint.yaml exists)
- [?] T007a Add token exchange endpoint to /api/enduser/openapi.yaml (POST /oauth2/token with grant_type detection) - NOT verified in OpenAPI file
- [ ] T007b [P] Get user/stakeholder confirmation for token exchange API design

- [x] T010a Map all 29 acceptance scenarios from spec.md to It() blocks (tests/e2e/token_exchange_test.go has all 29 It() blocks)
- [x] T010b Create test fixtures in tests/e2e/fixtures/ (mock JWTs, services with protected_resources, sessions) (fixtures used in tests)
- [x] T010c Create mock JWKS endpoint helper in tests/e2e/helpers/mock_upstream_jwks.go (DONE - JWKS endpoint implemented in mock_upstream.go + jwt_helpers.go created with SignTestJWT, GenerateTestRSAKeyPair, GenerateJWKSFromPublicKey functions)
- [x] T010d [P] Create RFC 8693 response matchers in tests/e2e/matchers/oauth2_matchers.go (HaveTokenExchangeSuccess) (matchers/oauth2_matchers.go exists with HaveTokenExchangeSuccess)
- [x] T010e Add comment references to spec scenarios in E2E test file (tests/e2e/token_exchange_test.go has // Spec Reference comments)
- [x] T010f Verify E2E tests FAIL initially (red phase) - E2E tests compile and run, semantically fail with 400 Bad Request (red phase verified)

**Scenario Mapping** (from spec.md):

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 6 - Admin Configures Protected Resources (Priority: P1) 🎯

**Goal**: Administrators can configure protected_resources on services via admin API

**Why First**: This is a prerequisite for resource-based service discovery (US2) which is needed for token exchange (US1)

- [x] T023 [US6] Add validation error response for invalid URI format (return 400) (services_handler.go, line 181, ValidateProtectedResources error handling)

**Checkpoint**: Admin API for protected_resources fully functional and testable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Resource-Based Service Discovery (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: System looks up third-party service by matching resource parameter against protected_resources

**Independent Test**: Token exchange request with resource parameter routes to correct service based on protected_resources match

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T024 [US2] Implement FindByProtectedResource for in-memory storage in internal/adapters/storage/memory/thirdparty_service.go (memory/thirdparty_services.go, 189 lines, FindByProtectedResource implemented)
- [x] T025 [P] [US2] Implement FindByProtectedResource for PostgreSQL storage in internal/adapters/storage/postgres/thirdparty_service.go (use GIN index with @> operator) (postgres/thirdparty_services.go, 757 lines, GIN index query with @>)

- [x] T028 [US2] Handle no-match case (return InvalidTarget error with descriptive message) (postgres adapter, error handling for no match)
- [x] T029 [US2] Handle ambiguous match case (multiple services match same resource, return InvalidTarget error) (postgres adapter, ambiguous match detection)

**Checkpoint**: Resource-based service discovery fully functional

---

## Phase 5: User Story 1 - Gateway Exchanges Token for Third-Party Token (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Gateway sends token exchange request, system validates tokens, verifies grant, returns third-party token

**Checkpoint**: Core token exchange flow working end-to-end

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - User Grant Verification (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: System verifies user has granted agent access to target service before returning tokens

**Independent Test**: Agent A (with user grant) gets tokens; Agent B (without grant) gets access_denied

### Implementation for User Story 3

**Checkpoint**: Grant verification integrated into token exchange flow

---

## Phase 7: User Story 4 - Gateway Authorization via CEL (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: System evaluates CEL expression to authorize gateways beyond basic JWT validation

**Independent Test**: CEL expression "client_assertion.iss == 'trusted-issuer'" allows matching gateways, denies others

- [x] T077 [US5] Include service_id and re-auth hint in error_description (service.go lines 233-237, 264-268)
- [x] T078 [US5] Distinguish between access_denied (no grant) and invalid_grant (no session) for grant-exists-but-session-missing edge case; ensure grant check occurs before session check in implementation order (service.go lines 207-224 occur BEFORE lines 228-252, per T078 CRITICAL security requirement)

**Checkpoint**: Error handling for missing/expired sessions complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US6 (P1)**: No dependencies - MUST complete first (enables US2)
- **US2 (P1)**: Depends on US6 - MUST complete second (enables US1)
- **US1 (P1)**: Depends on US2 - Core token exchange MVP
- **US3 (P1)**: Depends on US1 - Integrates grant verification
- **US4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - Adds CEL authorization layer
- **US5 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - Adds error handling for missing sessions

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (all can run in parallel)**:
- Domain model (2a) + Configuration (2b) + API design (2c) + Database (2d) + E2E tests (2e)

**Within Phase 2.5 (most can run in parallel)**:
- T011 JWKSPort + T012 Config + T013 Errors + T014 Constants + T016 Entity extension
- T015 depends on T016

**Within Phase 5 (US1)**:
- T030-T032 JWKS Adapter (parallel)
- T033-T036 Value Objects (parallel)
- T037-T042 JWT Validation (sequential - depends on adapter)
- T043-T046 Service (depends on validation)
- T047-T051 HTTP Handler (depends on service)

**After US1 Complete**:
- US3 (Grant Verification) and US4 (CEL Authorization) can proceed in parallel
- US5 (Session Errors) can proceed in parallel with US3/US4

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US6 → US2 → US1 → US3)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: All design preconditions (domain, config, API, DB, E2E tests)
3. Complete Phase 2.5: Foundational infrastructure
4. Complete Phase 3 (US6): Admin protected_resources API
5. Complete Phase 4 (US2): Resource-based service discovery
6. Complete Phase 5 (US1): Core token exchange
7. Complete Phase 6 (US3): Grant verification
8. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Full P1 functionality working, all P1 E2E tests pass
9. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP (P1 complete):
- Add Phase 7 (US4): CEL authorization → Deploy
- Add Phase 8 (US5): Session error handling → Deploy
- Complete Phase 9: Constitution compliance verification

| Phase | Task Count | Parallel Opportunities |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| Phase 1: Setup | 4 | 3 |
| Phase 2a: Domain Model | 4 | 1 |
| Phase 2b: Configuration | 3 | 2 |
| Phase 2c: API Design | 6 | 4 |
| Phase 2d: Database Design | 4 | 2 |
| Phase 2e: E2E Test Design | 7 | 1 |
| Phase 2.5: Foundational | 6 | 4 |
| Phase 3: US6 (Admin API) | 7 | 1 |
| Phase 4: US2 (Resource Discovery) | 6 | 1 |
| Phase 5: US1 (Token Exchange) | 32 | 8 |
| Phase 6: US3 (Grant Verification) | 7 | 0 |
| Phase 7: US4 (CEL Authorization) | 9 | 2 |
| Phase 8: US5 (Session Errors) | 4 | 0 |
| Phase 9: Compliance & Polish | 35 | 13 |
| **TOTAL** | **134** | **42** |

### Tasks per User Story

| User Story | Priority | Task Count |
|------------|----------|------------|
| US1 - Gateway Token Exchange | P1 | 32 |
| US2 - Resource Discovery | P1 | 6 |
| US3 - Grant Verification | P1 | 7 |
| US4 - CEL Authorization | P2 | 9 |
| US5 - Session Errors | P2 | 4 |
| US6 - Admin Protected Resources | P1 | 7 |

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 2.5 + US6 + US2 + US1 + US3**
- Task count: ~79 tasks
- All P1 user stories complete
- E2E tests: 20 P1 scenarios passing (US1: 6, US2: 5, US3: 4, US6: 5)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story independently completable and testable after its dependencies
- Verify E2E tests fail before implementing (red phase)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- JWKS adapter MUST abstract HTTP calls (per plan.md requirement)
- CEL expressions validated at startup (fail-fast)
- Token values MUST NOT appear in logs
