# Feature Specification: Persistence Layer

**Feature Branch**: `004-persistence-layer`
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Let's add a persistence layer to the application. Supported options are "in-memory" and PostgreSQL. The application can support a single database."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-15

- Q: When PostgreSQL connection pool is exhausted during high load, what should happen? → A: Queue requests with timeout, then fail (balanced approach)
- Q: What are the timeout values for storage operations? → A: 5 seconds for reads, 10 seconds for writes
- Q: What happens when PostgreSQL schema migrations are required but not applied? → A: Fail startup with clear error and migration instructions
- Q: How does in-memory storage behave when available memory is constrained? → A: No memory limit checking (intended for development/testing only)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Development and Testing with In-Memory Storage (Priority: P1)

Developers and testers need a lightweight, zero-configuration storage option that enables rapid development cycles and automated testing without external dependencies.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that unblocks all other work. Without this, developers cannot start building features that require data persistence. It also enables continuous integration testing without infrastructure setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the application with in-memory configuration, performing create/read/update/delete operations, restarting the application, and verifying that data does not persist across restarts. Delivers immediate value by enabling stateful development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is configured for in-memory storage, **When** a developer starts the application, **Then** the storage initializes instantly without requiring external services
2. **Given** data exists in in-memory storage, **When** the application restarts, **Then** all previously stored data is lost (ephemeral behavior)
3. **Given** multiple automated tests run concurrently, **When** each test uses in-memory storage, **Then** tests remain isolated without data interference
4. **Given** in-memory storage is active, **When** storage operations fail, **Then** clear error messages indicate the failure reason without exposing implementation details

---

### User Story 2 - Production Deployment with PostgreSQL (Priority: P2)

Operations teams need durable, production-grade storage that persists data across application restarts and supports backup/recovery procedures for business continuity.

**Why this priority**: Once development is complete (P1), production deployment becomes the next critical milestone. This enables the application to be used in real-world scenarios where data durability is essential.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring PostgreSQL connection parameters, starting the application, storing data, restarting the application, and verifying data persists. Delivers production readiness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid PostgreSQL connection credentials, **When** the application starts, **Then** the system connects to PostgreSQL and initializes required storage structures
2. **Given** data is stored in PostgreSQL, **When** the application restarts, **Then** all previously stored data remains accessible
3. **Given** PostgreSQL is unavailable, **When** the application starts, **Then** startup fails with a clear error message indicating connectivity issues
4. **Given** PostgreSQL connection is lost during operation, **When** storage operations are attempted, **Then** operations fail gracefully with retry capability for transient failures

---

### User Story 3 - Runtime Storage Configuration (Priority: P3)

System administrators need the ability to configure storage backend at deployment time without code changes, enabling different environments to use appropriate storage strategies.

**Why this priority**: After both storage backends are functional (P1, P2), flexible configuration improves operational efficiency and reduces deployment complexity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying the same application binary with different configuration files (one for in-memory, one for PostgreSQL) and verifying correct storage backend is used in each case.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configuration file specifies in-memory storage, **When** the application starts, **Then** in-memory storage is activated
2. **Given** a configuration file specifies PostgreSQL with connection parameters, **When** the application starts, **Then** PostgreSQL storage is activated with those parameters
3. **Given** configuration contains invalid storage type, **When** the application starts, **Then** startup fails with clear error indicating valid storage options
4. **Given** PostgreSQL is configured but required parameters are missing, **When** the application starts, **Then** startup fails with specific error listing missing parameters

### Edge Cases

- What happens when PostgreSQL connection pool is exhausted during high load? → Storage requests are queued with a timeout; requests exceeding the timeout fail with a clear error indicating resource exhaustion
- How does the system handle storage operations that exceed reasonable timeouts? → Read operations timeout after 5 seconds, write operations timeout after 10 seconds, both returning clear timeout errors
- What happens when PostgreSQL schema migrations are required but not applied? → Application startup fails with clear error message indicating required migrations and instructions for applying them
- How does in-memory storage behave when available memory is constrained? → No memory limit checking; intended for development/testing environments with adequate memory allocation
- What happens when storage backend is switched between restarts with existing data in PostgreSQL?
- How does the system handle malformed connection strings or unreachable database hosts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support in-memory storage as a storage backend option
- **FR-002**: System MUST support PostgreSQL as a storage backend option
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow selection of exactly one storage backend at runtime via configuration
- **FR-004**: In-memory storage MUST NOT persist data across application restarts
- **FR-005**: PostgreSQL storage MUST persist data across application restarts
- **FR-006**: System MUST initialize storage backend during application startup
- **FR-007**: System MUST fail application startup if storage backend initialization fails
- **FR-008**: Storage configuration MUST specify which backend to use (in-memory or PostgreSQL)
- **FR-009**: PostgreSQL configuration MUST accept a connection string URL in the format postgresql://user:password@host:port/database with optional query parameters for SSL and other connection settings
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate storage configuration before attempting to initialize storage backend
- **FR-011**: Storage operations MUST handle errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear error messages when PostgreSQL is unreachable during startup
- **FR-013**: System MUST verify PostgreSQL schema is current during startup and fail with migration instructions if schema updates are required

### Security Requirements *(mandatory for security-critical features)*

- **SR-001**: PostgreSQL connection credentials MUST NOT be logged in plain text
- **SR-002**: PostgreSQL connections MUST support TLS/SSL encryption when configured
- **SR-003**: System MUST fail closed if PostgreSQL SSL verification fails when SSL is required
- **SR-004**: Storage configuration MUST protect sensitive connection parameters from unauthorized access
- **SR-005**: Database connection errors MUST NOT expose sensitive credential information in error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Storage Backend**: Represents the persistence mechanism (in-memory or PostgreSQL) responsible for storing and retrieving application data. Each backend provides consistent storage operations while handling persistence differently.

- **Storage Configuration**: Defines which storage backend to use and its associated parameters. For in-memory, requires no additional parameters. For PostgreSQL, requires connection parameters such as host, port, database name, and credentials.

- **Connection Parameters**: Set of configuration values required to establish and maintain a connection to PostgreSQL, including host address, port number, database name, authentication credentials, and connection pool settings.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application startup with in-memory storage completes in under 1 second without external dependencies
- **SC-002**: Application successfully persists data across restarts when using PostgreSQL storage
- **SC-003**: Storage backend can be switched between in-memory and PostgreSQL by changing configuration alone, without code modifications
- **SC-004**: 100% of storage initialization failures result in clear error messages identifying the root cause
- **SC-005**: PostgreSQL connection failures during startup prevent application from starting in an inconsistent state
- **SC-006**: Storage read operations complete or timeout within 5 seconds; write operations complete or timeout within 10 seconds

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- The application requires persistent storage for its core functionality (not specified what data, but persistence layer implies data to persist)
- PostgreSQL version 12 or higher is assumed as the target database version based on industry standard support cycles
- Connection pooling for PostgreSQL is handled by standard database driver libraries
- In-memory storage is suitable only for development, testing, and demonstration purposes, not production workloads; assumes adequate memory allocation in development environments without requiring memory limit enforcement
- The application operates as a single instance (no distributed storage coordination required)
- Storage migration between backends (in-memory to PostgreSQL) is out of scope - each backend is independent
- Database schema management and migrations are handled separately from this persistence layer feature
- The same storage interface is used regardless of backend, allowing application code to remain backend-agnostic

## Dependencies *(include if applicable)*

- PostgreSQL database server (version 12+) must be available and accessible when using PostgreSQL backend
- Database connection driver library compatible with the application's programming language
- Configuration system capable of specifying storage backend selection and connection parameters
- Network connectivity to PostgreSQL server when using that backend

## Out of Scope *(include if applicable)*

- Database schema design and table definitions for specific application entities
- Data migration tools for moving data between storage backends
- Database backup and restoration procedures
- Query optimization and performance tuning
- Database replication and high availability configurations
- Support for multiple simultaneous storage backends
- Support for additional storage backends beyond in-memory and PostgreSQL (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) layer or query builder abstractions
- Database connection pooling configuration beyond standard driver defaults
- Storage backend-specific monitoring and observability tooling
