# Specification Quality Checklist: Consent Management Frontend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All validation checks passed successfully:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Uses business language (user, agent, grant, service, scope) without mentioning specific technologies. Written for stakeholders to understand user value.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
   - All 20 functional requirements are testable and map to acceptance scenarios
   - All 9 security requirements are enforceable and verifiable
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (time in seconds, percentages, user counts)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can view delegations in under 3 seconds" not "React renders in X ms")
   - Edge cases cover error conditions, concurrent access, missing data, and performance scenarios
   - Scope clearly separates in-scope from out-of-scope features
   - Dependencies list backend APIs from 006-domain-model-apis
   - Assumptions document session management, authentication, and browser expectations

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-020) maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - Three prioritized user stories (P1: View, P2: Review, P3: Manage) cover the complete user journey
   - Success criteria define measurable outcomes: load times (SC-001, SC-002, SC-008), completion rates (SC-004), user understanding (SC-005, SC-010), performance (SC-009)
   - No implementation details in spec (no mention of React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, specific libraries)

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no updates required.

The spec properly references the domain model from [006-domain-model-apis](../../006-domain-model-apis/spec.md) and uses the established entities (Agent, Thirdparty OAuth2 Service, OAuth Scope, User Grant) without redefining them.
