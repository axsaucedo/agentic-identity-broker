# Specification Quality Checklist: Wildcard CIMD Client URI Registration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before implementation.
**Created**: 2026-09-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] The specification has no implementation details.
- [x] The specification explains the operator value.
- [x] All mandatory sections are present.
- [x] The specification extends 028 without rewriting its history.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain.
- [x] The requirements are testable and unambiguous.
- [x] The success criteria are measurable.
- [x] The success criteria do not depend on a technology choice.
- [x] The acceptance scenarios cover the primary flow.
- [x] The edge cases include ambiguous patterns and literal or encoded path separators.
- [x] The scope excludes host wildcards, `**`, and partial-segment wildcards.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Each functional requirement has an acceptance outcome.
- [x] The security requirements preserve the concrete CIMD URL trust model.
- [x] The API contract defines the administrative input before code changes.

## Notes

- The feature uses whole-segment path wildcards only.
- The broker rejects literal `\`, `%2F`, and `%5C` in client URI paths before matching.
- An exact URI takes precedence. Multiple matching Agents cause a fail-closed rejection.
