# Tasks: End-User Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-end-user-docs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), spec.md (✓), research.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list (not requested in spec). Quality assurance is handled through manual review and user feedback mechanisms documented in the plan.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1-US5) to enable independent documentation creation and validation. Each story can be written, reviewed, and published independently.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all content writing
- **Phases 3-7 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 2 - Can proceed in parallel or sequentially
- **Phase 8 (Additional Sections)**: Can start after Phase 2, alongside user stories
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: Depends on all other phases

### User Story Dependencies

**All user stories are independently testable and can be written in parallel or sequence**:

- **US1 (Onboarding)**: No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Quick Setup)**: No dependencies on other stories (links to US1 but independent)
- **US3 (Feature Reference)**: No dependencies on other stories
- **US4 (API Integration)**: No dependencies on other stories (references Feature Reference but independent)
- **US5 (Troubleshooting)**: No dependencies on other stories

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 Setup Tasks** marked [P] can run in parallel:
- T001: Initialize Docusaurus (dependency for others)
- T002-T007: All independent setup tasks can run in parallel

**Phase 2 Foundational Tasks** marked [P] can run in parallel:
- T009-T014: All placeholder creation tasks independent
- T015-T016: Both can run after T009

**User Story Phases 3-7**:
- All 5 user stories can be written in parallel by different writers
- Within each story, all research tasks can run in parallel
- Content writing within a story follows: research → write → review → link

**Phase 8 Additional Sections** marked [P] can run in parallel:
- Architecture, Security, Contributing sections all independent

### Example Parallel Execution

**Recommended Team Approach** (5 developers):

```
Developer 1: Phase 1 Setup → Phase 2 Foundational → US1 Introduction
Developer 2: US2 Quick Start (after Phase 2)
Developer 3: US3 Features (after Phase 2)
Developer 4: US4 API (after Phase 2)
Developer 5: US5 Troubleshooting (after Phase 2)

Parallel: While developers 2-5 write, Developer 1 works on Phase 8 Additional Sections
Final: All work together on Phase 9 Polish & QA
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Minimum viable documentation for launch**:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T016)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T017-T022)
4. Complete Phase 9: Polish & QA (T064-T084)

**Result**: New developers can understand what Agentic Identity Broker is and why they might want to use it
- Introduction pages explain purpose and differentiation
- Landing page guides users to quick start
- Ready for demo/feedback from community

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 developers for 1-2 weeks

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP (US1):

1. **Week 2**: Add US2 (Quick Setup) - developers can now get broker running
2. **Week 3**: Add US3 (Features) + US4 (API) - developers understand capabilities and can integrate
3. **Week 4**: Add US5 (Troubleshooting) + Phase 8 sections - comprehensive documentation
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain and update per constitution principle IV

### Parallel Team Strategy (Full Documentation)

With 5+ developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Phase 1 + Phase 2 together
2. **Week 2-3**: Team splits across User Stories (US1-US5 in parallel)
3. **Week 4**: All team members work on Phase 8 + Phase 9 integration

**Result**: Complete documentation ready for v0.1.0 release

## Content Writing Guidelines

### Using Technical-Writer Agent

For content generation, use `/task` with technical-writer agent:

```
Prompt Template:
"Write documentation page for [page name] in [section].
Project: Agentic Identity Broker
Audience: Developers with basic identity knowledge
Tone: Technical but approachable
Requirements: Include working examples, show security considerations

Context: [copy relevant section from spec.md]
"
```

### Quality Criteria for Content

Each page should have:

1. **Title & Description**: Clear frontmatter with `title:` and `description:`
2. **Opening**: 1-2 sentence explanation of what the page covers
3. **Quick Example**: Concrete working example (code block or screenshot)
4. **Details**: Explanation of how it works, why it matters
5. **Configuration**: Options, defaults, security implications
6. **Examples**: Real-world use cases or patterns
7. **Related Links**: Cross-references to related documentation pages
8. **"Coming Soon" markers**: For unimplemented features (per spec.md edge cases)

### Testing Content Quality

Before marking content as complete:

- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] All links are valid (internal and external)
- [ ] Tone is consistent with project voice
- [ ] No proprietary information leaked
- [ ] Meets success criteria from user story

---

## Notes

- Each phase is independently completable
- User stories can be implemented in any order or in parallel
- Tests not included in this task list (can add if TDD approach requested)
- Tasks marked [P] = parallelizable (different files, no blocking dependencies)
- Tasks with [US#] = part of specific user story
- Focus on independent testability: each story should be completable without others
- Use Constitution Principle IV as guide: "Documentation & API Transparency"
- Commit after each task or logical group (each page completion)

---

## Success Metrics

Track progress against spec.md success criteria:

- **SC-001**: New developers understand project in <5 minutes of reading Introduction
- **SC-002**: Quick Start completable in 15 minutes with verification
- **SC-003**: 90% of feature questions answerable from Feature Reference
- **SC-004**: API integration possible using only API Documentation
- **SC-005**: 100% coverage: all public APIs, config options, error codes documented
- **SC-006**: All 8 standard OSS sections present (✓ In plan)
- **SC-007**: Zero broken links + no outdated examples
- **SC-008**: Positive feedback from first 10 external contributors
