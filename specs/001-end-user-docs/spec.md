# Feature Specification: End-User Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `001-end-user-docs`
**Created**: 2025-12-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "end-user documentation: Let's fill the docs/ directory with life and and sections for Introduction, Quick start, Feature Reference, API Documentation. This is a OSS project that is similar but different to an identity provider. Make suggestions if sections would be missing compared to typical documentation. The content can be very basic to get started."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Onboarding (Priority: P1)

A developer discovers the Agentic Identity Broker project and needs to understand what it is, why it exists, and how it differs from traditional identity providers. They need enough context to decide if this project fits their needs.

**Why this priority**: First impressions determine adoption. Without clear introduction and value proposition, developers will abandon the project before trying it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a new developer reading the Introduction section and answering: "What is this project?" "Why would I use it?" "How is it different from Keycloak/Auth0?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer unfamiliar with agentic identity systems, **When** they read the Introduction, **Then** they understand the project's purpose and core concepts
2. **Given** a developer evaluating identity solutions, **When** they read the Introduction, **Then** they can distinguish this from traditional identity providers
3. **Given** a technical decision maker, **When** they review the documentation, **Then** they understand the use cases and benefits for agentic systems

### User Story 2 - Quick Setup and First Success (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to quickly set up the Agentic Identity Broker locally and see it working within 10-15 minutes. They need step-by-step instructions for installation, basic configuration, and verification.

**Why this priority**: Fast initial success builds confidence and momentum. Complex setup processes lead to abandonment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following Quick Start guide from scratch on a clean machine and reaching a "hello world" moment (e.g., issuing first identity token).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** prerequisites are installed, **When** developer follows Quick Start steps, **Then** broker is running locally within 15 minutes
2. **Given** broker is running, **When** developer executes verification command, **Then** they receive confirmation of successful setup
3. **Given** successful setup, **When** developer wants to explore further, **Then** Quick Start links to relevant Feature Reference sections

---

### User Story 3 - Feature Discovery and Understanding (Priority: P3)

A developer needs to understand available features, capabilities, and configuration options. They want to discover what's possible with the broker beyond the basic setup.

**Why this priority**: Enables developers to leverage advanced capabilities and make informed architectural decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by developer locating specific feature documentation (e.g., "How do I configure signature verification?") and understanding the feature's purpose and configuration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer with a specific need (e.g., token expiration), **When** they search Feature Reference, **Then** they find relevant documentation
2. **Given** a feature description, **When** developer reads it, **Then** they understand what it does, why it's useful, and how to enable/configure it
3. **Given** multiple configuration options, **When** developer reviews Feature Reference, **Then** they understand trade-offs and defaults

---

### User Story 4 - API Integration (Priority: P4)

A developer needs to integrate their application with the broker's APIs. They need endpoint documentation, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and error handling details.

**Why this priority**: Core integration capability, but less urgent than understanding the project and getting it running.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by developer making API calls using only the documentation (no external support) and handling both success and error cases.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an API endpoint documentation page, **When** developer reads it, **Then** they understand the purpose, required parameters, and response format
2. **Given** API documentation, **When** developer makes requests, **Then** they handle authentication, errors, and edge cases correctly
3. **Given** multiple API endpoints, **When** developer wants to accomplish a task, **Then** they identify which endpoints to use and in what order

---

### User Story 5 - Troubleshooting and Support (Priority: P5)

A developer encounters issues during setup, configuration, or integration. They need troubleshooting guidance, common problems, and support channels.

**Why this priority**: Reduces friction for adopters, but can be addressed through community support initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating common problems and verifying documentation provides resolution paths.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a common error (e.g., connection failure), **When** developer checks troubleshooting guide, **Then** they find cause and resolution
2. **Given** an issue not covered in docs, **When** developer seeks help, **Then** they know where to ask questions (GitHub issues, discussions, etc.)
3. **Given** configuration questions, **When** developer reviews documentation, **Then** they find configuration examples and best practices

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation references features not yet implemented? (Clear "coming soon" markers)
- How does system handle outdated documentation after API changes? (Version indicators and migration guides)
- What if developer's environment differs from documented prerequisites? (Clear prerequisite versions and OS compatibility)
- How do users find documentation for specific versions? (Version selector or branch-based docs)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## Assumptions

1. Target audience is developers with basic understanding of identity systems and APIs
2. Documentation will be hosted in the `docs/` directory and rendered via GitHub or static site generator
3. Project is in early stages, so some features may be documented as "coming soon" with clear roadmap indicators
4. Documentation will be versioned alongside code releases
5. English is the primary language (internationalization can be added later)
6. Examples will use common tools (curl, Go, popular languages) that are widely accessible
7. Documentation will link to external resources (RFCs, standards) rather than reproducing them
8. Configuration examples will use YAML format (assuming broker uses YAML config files)

## Dependencies

- Project ARCHITECTURE.md file must exist and be reasonably complete (already exists)
- Constitution document must exist for referencing governance principles (already exists)
- At least basic working implementation of broker to document (unclear current state)
- Decisions about configuration format, API design, and deployment model (can document these as they're decided)

## Out of Scope

- Automatically generated API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger generation) - can be added later
- Interactive documentation playground or sandbox environment
- Video tutorials or animated demos
- Documentation in languages other than English
- Detailed performance benchmarking and tuning guides (beyond basic production recommendations)
- Comprehensive migration guides from other identity systems (too early in project lifecycle)
