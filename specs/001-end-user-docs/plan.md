# Implementation Plan: End-User Documentation

**Branch**: `001-end-user-docs` | **Date**: 2025-12-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-end-user-docs/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature establishes comprehensive end-user documentation for the Agentic Identity Broker project using Docusaurus as the documentation framework. The documentation will be structured into key sections (Introduction, Quick Start, Feature Reference, API Documentation, Troubleshooting, Contributing, Security, Architecture, and Glossary) to support developer onboarding, integration, and contribution. Content will be authored by technical writers using Docusaurus' markdown-based system, with automation via Justfile for building documentation.

**Technical Approach**:
- Use Docusaurus 3.x for static site generation with markdown-based content
- Structure documentation in `docs/` directory following Docusaurus conventions
- Introduce Justfile build automation with `just docs` command for building/serving documentation
- Create placeholder content with initial text for all required sections
- Use technical-writer agent to generate production-quality content

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+ (for Docusaurus), Markdown for content
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.x, React 18+, MDX for enhanced markdown
**Storage**: File-based (markdown files in `docs/` directory)
**Testing**: Docusaurus built-in validation, link checking, markdown linting
**Target Platform**: Static site (deployable to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host)
**Project Type**: Documentation site (separate from main application)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads (<2s initial, <500ms navigation), good SEO
**Constraints**: Must work offline-first for local development, versioning support for future releases
**Scale/Scope**: 10-15 initial documentation pages covering all standard OSS sections

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Before proceeding, verify compliance with [.specify/memory/constitution.md](../../.specify/memory/constitution.md):

- [x] **Security-First**: N/A - Documentation feature does not implement security controls
- [x] **Architecture Docs**: Yes - Will update ARCHITECTURE.md to document documentation infrastructure and glossary
- [x] **ADRs**: Yes - Requires ADR for Docusaurus selection and documentation structure
- [x] **Library-First Security**: N/A - No cryptographic operations in documentation
- [x] **API Documentation**: Yes - This feature creates the API documentation framework (FR-004)
- [x] **Domain Model**: Yes - Will populate ARCHITECTURE.md Glossary with domain concepts
- [x] **Hexagonal Architecture**: N/A - Documentation is infrastructure, not domain logic

**Constitution Compliance**: PASSED
- This feature directly fulfills Constitution Principle IV (Documentation & API Transparency)
- Requires ADR documenting choice of Docusaurus over alternatives (MkDocs, VitePress, Sphinx)
- Will establish the documentation infrastructure that future features must maintain

```

**Structure Decision**: Documentation site is separate from main application (which doesn't exist yet). Docusaurus manages its own build tooling in `assets/docusaurus/` directory with content in `docs/`. This separation allows documentation to be built/deployed independently.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No violations - all Constitution checks passed or are N/A for documentation feature.

## Phase 0: Research & Technology Selection

### Research Tasks

1. **Docusaurus vs. Alternatives**
   - Evaluate Docusaurus 3.x vs. MkDocs, VitePress, Sphinx
   - Consider: React ecosystem, versioning, search, MDX support, deployment
   - Document decision in ADR

2. **Docusaurus Configuration Best Practices**
   - Research recommended structure for OSS projects
   - Identify plugins needed: search, analytics, versioning
   - Determine sidebars navigation pattern

3. **Justfile Integration**
   - Research Justfile syntax and patterns
   - Determine commands needed: build, serve, clean, deploy
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL)

4. **Content Structure Patterns**
   - Research documentation organization for identity/security projects (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0, Okta)
   - Determine information architecture
   - Plan progressive disclosure (basic → advanced)

5. **Technical Writer Agent Integration**
   - Research how to provide effective context to technical-writer agent
   - Determine content generation workflow
   - Plan content review and validation process

### Decisions Needed

- **Docusaurus version**: 3.x (latest stable) vs 2.x (more stable)
- **Deployment target**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or self-hosted
- **Versioning strategy**: Start with single version or prepare for multi-version from day 1
- **Search**: Algolia DocSearch (requires application) vs local search plugin

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts

### Documentation Structure Contract

**File**: `contracts/docs-structure.yaml`

Defines the documentation site structure, navigation, and content templates:

```yaml
site:
  title: "Agentic Identity Broker Documentation"
  tagline: "Identity brokering for agentic systems"
  navigation:
    - section: "Introduction"
      pages: ["index", "why-not-idp", "use-cases"]
    - section: "Quick Start"
      pages: ["index", "prerequisites", "installation", "verification"]
    - section: "Features"
      pages: ["index", "authentication", "authorization", "configuration"]
    - section: "API Reference"
      pages: ["index", "authentication", "error-codes"]
    - section: "Architecture"
      pages: ["index", "concepts", "glossary"]
    - section: "Security"
      pages: ["index", "best-practices", "compliance"]
    - section: "Troubleshooting"
      pages: ["index", "faq"]
    - section: "Contributing"
      pages: ["index", "code-of-conduct", "development"]
```

### Docusaurus Setup Quickstart

**File**: `quickstart.md`

Step-by-step guide for setting up the Docusaurus documentation site:

1. Install Node.js 18+ and npm
2. Initialize Docusaurus in `website/` directory
3. Configure `docusaurus.config.js` with project details
4. Set up `sidebars.js` navigation
5. Create initial documentation structure in `docs/`
6. Test local development server (`npm start`)
7. Configure Justfile automation

### ADR Required

**File**: `adrs/001-docusaurus-for-documentation.md`

Document the architectural decision to use Docusaurus, including:
- Context: Need for OSS documentation site
- Decision: Docusaurus 3.x with React/MDX
- Alternatives: MkDocs, VitePress, Sphinx, GitBook
- Consequences: Node.js dependency, React ecosystem, MDX capabilities

## Phase 2: Task Breakdown

**Not generated by this command** - Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks.

Tasks will include:
1. Install and configure Docusaurus
2. Create documentation directory structure
3. Write placeholder content for all sections
4. Configure Justfile automation
5. Use technical-writer agent to generate content
6. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with documentation infrastructure
7. Create ADR for Docusaurus selection
8. Test documentation build and deployment
9. Set up CI/CD for documentation deployment

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Writer Agent Usage

When generating content with the technical-writer agent, provide:

1. **Context**: Project is an "Agentic Identity Broker" - similar to but different from traditional identity providers
2. **Audience**: Developers with basic identity system knowledge
3. **Tone**: Technical but approachable, security-focused
4. **Structure**: Follow Docusaurus markdown conventions
5. **Requirements**:
   - All sections from FR-001 through FR-015
   - Code examples for common integration patterns
   - Clear differentiation from traditional IdPs
   - Security best practices throughout

### Justfile Commands

Planned commands for `justfile`:

```justfile
# Build documentation site
docs-build:
    cd assets/docusaurus && npm run build

# Serve documentation locally
docs-serve:
    cd assets/docusaurus && npm start

# Clean build artifacts
docs-clean:
    cd assets/docusaurus && npm run clear

# Install dependencies
docs-install:
    cd assets/docusaurus && npm install

# Combined: build documentation
docs: docs-install docs-build
```

### Deployment Considerations

- GitHub Pages: Deploy `assets/docusaurus/build/` directory to `gh-pages` branch
- Netlify: Connect repository, set build command to `cd assets/docusaurus && npm run build`
- Vercel: Similar to Netlify with automatic deployments
- Self-hosted: Serve static files from `assets/docusaurus/build/`

## Success Criteria Validation

This plan addresses all success criteria from the specification:

- **SC-001**: Introduction content will be structured for 5-minute comprehension
- **SC-002**: Quick Start guide targets 15-minute setup with verification
- **SC-003**: Feature Reference with searchable content addresses 90% self-service goal
- **SC-004**: API Documentation structure supports zero-clarification integration
- **SC-005**: Documentation structure ensures complete coverage via contracts
- **SC-006**: All standard OSS sections included in structure
- **SC-007**: Docusaurus validates links automatically, markdown linting prevents outdated examples
- **SC-008**: Clear contributing guide and structure enables positive contributor experience

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for Docusaurus)
- Just command runner (for build automation)

### Internal Dependencies
- ARCHITECTURE.md must be updated with documentation infrastructure
- Constitution references throughout documentation
- Glossary population from domain model (as broker features are developed)

### Assumptions Validated
- Target audience: developers (confirmed in spec)
- Hosting: Static site generation allows any platform (flexibility maintained)
- Early stage: Placeholders acceptable, "coming soon" markers for unimplemented features
- Version strategy: Single version initially, versioning support available when needed

## Next Steps

After approval of this plan:

1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable task breakdown
2. Begin Phase 0 research (Docusaurus evaluation, ADR drafting)
3. Set up Docusaurus infrastructure
4. Engage technical-writer agent for content generation
5. Iterate on content quality and structure
6. Deploy to staging environment for review
