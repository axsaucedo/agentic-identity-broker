# Feature Specification: Docker Setup

**Feature Branch**: `010-docker-setup`
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docker setup"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Build Complete Application Image (Priority: P1)

A developer or CI/CD pipeline needs to package the entire application (backend and frontend services) into a single production artifact for deployment to target environments and container registries.

**Why this priority**: Containerized artifacts are essential for modern deployment. A single image containing both backend and frontend enables consistent, reproducible deployments across environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by building and running the application artifact, verifying that both services initialize successfully and can communicate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a build process is executed, **When** creating a containerized application artifact, **Then** the build succeeds and produces a runnable package containing both backend and frontend components.
2. **Given** the containerized application artifact is deployed and running, **When** the application initializes, **Then** both backend and frontend services start successfully and are ready to handle requests.
3. **Given** the application is running in the containerized environment, **When** frontend logic attempts to communicate with backend services, **Then** requests are routed correctly and responses are received successfully.

### User Story 2 - Integrate Application Artifact Building into Task Automation (Priority: P1)

Developers want to build containerized application artifacts using the existing task automation system, so that all build operations (backend, frontend, artifact creation) follow the same workflow pattern and are easily discoverable.

**Why this priority**: Consistency in developer workflow reduces friction and cognitive load. Build operations should be discoverable alongside other development tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running build tasks through the task automation system and verifying they successfully produce a deployable application artifact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the task automation system is updated with artifact building capabilities, **When** a developer invokes the containerized artifact build task, **Then** the build succeeds and produces a runnable application package.
2. **Given** a built application artifact exists, **When** a developer invokes the deployment/run task through the task automation system, **Then** the application starts successfully with all services running.
3. **Given** a developer lists available tasks in the task automation system, **Then** artifact building and deployment tasks are visible with descriptions.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the build environment is missing required dependencies? The system should provide clear error messaging.
- How are configuration values passed to the deployed application? Configuration should be customizable without modifying the artifact.
- What happens if required system resources are unavailable during deployment? The system should fail gracefully with helpful diagnostics.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support building a complete application artifact that packages both backend and frontend components.
- **FR-002**: System MUST optimize artifact size through multi-stage build processes (separate build and runtime phases).
- **FR-003**: System MUST structure the artifact build to support future multi-architecture deployments across different processor architectures.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support pre-built application binaries as input to the artifact creation process.
- **FR-005**: System MUST compile and include frontend assets in the final application artifact.
- **FR-006**: System MUST configure the backend to serve frontend content from within the artifact.
- **FR-007**: System MUST exclude non-essential files from the artifact to minimize size.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a build task in the task automation system that creates a deployable application artifact.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a deployment/run task in the task automation system that executes the built application artifact.
- **FR-010**: System MUST minimize artifact runtime dependencies through appropriate image selection.
- **FR-011**: System MUST expose required application service ports in the artifact definition.
- **FR-012**: System MUST configure the artifact to execute the application on startup.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Build process completes successfully without errors, packaging all application components.
- **SC-002**: Deployed application artifact runs successfully and accepts HTTP requests on configured backend service port.
- **SC-003**: Frontend user interface is accessible and loads successfully within the running application artifact.
- **SC-004**: Frontend components can successfully communicate with backend services and exchange data.
- **SC-005**: Task automation system build command produces a deployable application artifact successfully.
- **SC-006**: Task automation system deployment command starts the application artifact with all services ready within 30 seconds.
- **SC-007**: Final application artifact is optimized for size and performance.
- **SC-008**: Application handles clean shutdown of all service components gracefully.
- **SC-009**: Application artifact structure supports future multi-architecture deployment scenarios.
- **SC-010**: Application artifact size is minimized compared to single-stage builds.

## Assumptions

- Build environment has containerization capability installed.
- Build environment has compiler toolchain available for backend compilation.
- Build environment has node runtime available for frontend compilation.
- Application backend service is accessible on a standard application port.
- Frontend is compiled to static assets and served by the backend service.
- External services (database, etc.) are configured through environment-based configuration.
- Pre-compiled application binaries can be provided as input to the artifact build process.

## Out of Scope

- Multi-container orchestration for local development.
- Cloud platform deployment configurations.
- CI/CD pipeline integration and automation.
- Artifact registry operations and distribution.
- Multi-architecture build automation (can be added as a separate feature).
