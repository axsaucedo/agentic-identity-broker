**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle VIII (Test-Driven Development & Automated Testing), automated tests are MANDATORY for all features. Test tasks are included in each user story below and MUST be written before or alongside implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Terminate Third-Party Session with Warnings (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can revoke sessions with warning about affected agents before deletion.

**Independent Test**: User clicks "Terminate Session", sees warning dialog listing affected agents, confirms, session and tokens deleted.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 fully functional - users can terminate sessions with warnings

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Secure State Token Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: JWE state tokens securely bind OAuth2 flows to users with CSRF protection and tamper detection.

**Independent Test**: State tokens contain all required claims, validation rejects expired/tampered/mismatched tokens.

*Note: This story is implemented alongside US2 (InitiateOAuth2Flow and HandleCallback). These tasks focus on security-specific testing and validation.*

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Design Preconditions (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all implementation
  - Phase 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e can proceed in parallel
- **Foundational Infrastructure (Phase 2.5)**: Depends on ALL of Phase 2 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Phase 2 + Phase 2.5 completion
  - US1 (P1), US2 (P2), US4 (P2) can proceed in parallel
  - US3 (P3) can also proceed in parallel but is lower priority
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2.5 - MVP, no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2.5 - Core OAuth2 flow
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Implements security for US2 - Run tests after US2 implementation
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2.5 - Depends on session existing (US2 for full testing)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Domain logic before HTTP handlers
- Backend before frontend
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (all parallel)**:
- T001, T002, T003 can run simultaneously

**Phase 2 (parallel within sub-phases)**:
- T005, T006 (2a) in parallel
- T007, T008, T009 (2b) in parallel
- T011, T012 (2c) in parallel
- T013, T014, T015 (2d) in parallel
- T016, T017, T018 (2e) in parallel

**Phase 2.5 (partial parallel)**:
- T020, T021, T023, T024, T026 can run in parallel
- T019, T022, T025, T027 are blocking

**User Story Tests (parallel within story)**:
- All [P] marked test tasks within a story can run in parallel

**Different Stories (parallel if team capacity)**:
- US1, US2, US3, US4 can be worked on by different developers after Phase 2.5

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Tests

```bash
# Launch all US2 tests together:
Task T043: "Unit tests for GeneratePKCE()"
Task T044: "Unit tests for CreateStateToken(), ValidateStateToken()"
Task T045: "Unit tests for InitiateOAuth2Flow()"
Task T046: "Unit tests for HandleCallback()"
Task T047: "Integration tests for authorize endpoint"
Task T048: "Integration tests for callback endpoint"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Design Preconditions (T004-T018)
3. Complete Phase 2.5: Foundational Infrastructure (T019-T027)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T028-T042)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
6. Deploy/demo session viewing capability

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup → Design → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → MVP: Session viewing ✓
3. Add User Story 2 + 4 → OAuth2 flow with security ✓
4. Add User Story 3 → Session termination ✓
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

**Developer 1 (Backend)**:
- Phase 2.5: Domain entities and repositories
- US1: Service and handler implementation
- US2: OAuth2 flow implementation

**Developer 2 (Frontend)**:
- Phase 2e: Design system review
- US1: React components after backend ready
- US3: TerminationDialog after US1 complete

**Developer 3 (Security/Testing)**:
- All test tasks across user stories
- US4: Security verification
- Phase 7: Compliance verification

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
