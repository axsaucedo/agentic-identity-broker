# Tasks: OAuth2 Authorization Server Proxy

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-oauth2-auth-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Test tasks are included per Constitution Principle VIII (TDD is mandatory for all features)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story with tests BEFORE implementation to enable TDD workflow

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational Infrastructure (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Tests BEFORE implementation
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Tests BEFORE implementation, independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Tests BEFORE implementation, independent of US1/US2
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on completion of desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other user stories - Can start after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: No dependencies on US1 - Can run in parallel with US1 after Phase 2
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: No dependencies on US1/US2 - Can run in parallel with US1/US2 after Phase 2

**Key Insight**: All three user stories are fully independent and can be implemented in parallel once foundational infrastructure (Phase 2) is complete.

### TDD Workflow Within Each User Story

1. **Write tests FIRST** (T014-T018 for US1, T028-T030 for US2, T035-T037 for US3)
2. **Run tests** - verify they FAIL (no implementation yet)
3. **Implement code** (T019-T027 for US1, T031-T034 for US2, T038-T041 for US3)
4. **Run tests** - verify they PASS
5. **Refactor** if needed while keeping tests green

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel after T002 completes

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Tasks T007, T008, T009, T010, T011, T013 can all run in parallel after T006 completes

**Phase 3 (US1) Tests**: Tasks T014, T015, T016, T017, T018 can all run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1) Implementation**: Tasks T019, T020, T023, T026 can run in parallel; T021, T022, T024 sequential; T025, T027 sequential after handlers ready

**Phase 4 (US2) Tests**: Tasks T028, T029, T030 can all run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2) Implementation**: Tasks T031, T033 can run in parallel; T032, T034 sequential

**Phase 5 (US3) Tests**: Tasks T035, T036, T037 can all run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3) Implementation**: Tasks T038, T039 can run in parallel; T040, T041 sequential

**Phase 6 (Polish)**: Tasks T042, T043, T044, T045, T046, T047, T048, T049, T050, T051, T057, T058, T059 can all run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelism**: Once Phase 2 completes, all of Phase 3, Phase 4, and Phase 5 can run in parallel with different team members/agents

## Parallel Example: TDD Workflow for User Story 1

```bash
# Step 1: Write all tests in parallel
Task T014: "Unit test for HandleAuthorization with table-driven tests"
Task T015: "Unit test for buildUpstreamAuthorizeURL"
Task T016: "Unit test for OAuth2AuthorizeHandler.ServeHTTP"
Task T017: "Unit test for OAuth2AuditMiddleware"
Task T018: "Integration test for authorization endpoint"

# Step 2: Run tests - verify they FAIL
go test ./internal/domain/oauth2/... -v  # Should fail (no implementation)
go test ./internal/adapters/http/enduser/... -v  # Should fail

# Step 3: Implement code (some in parallel)
Task T019: "Create service.go with service struct"
Task T020: "Define OAuth2Config struct"
Task T023: "Create oauth2_authorize.go handler"
Task T026: "Create oauth2_audit.go middleware"

# Step 4: Complete implementation sequentially
Task T021: "Implement HandleAuthorization method"
Task T022: "Add buildUpstreamAuthorizeURL helper"
Task T024: "Implement ServeHTTP handler"
Task T025: "Add route to router"
Task T027: "Wire middleware"

# Step 5: Run tests - verify they PASS
go test ./internal/domain/oauth2/... -v  # Should pass
go test ./internal/adapters/http/enduser/... -v  # Should pass
just test-integration  # Should pass
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 with TDD)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005) including config validation test
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (T006-T013) including TLS client test
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T027) **following TDD workflow**:
   - Write all tests (T014-T018)
   - Verify tests fail
   - Implement code (T019-T027)
   - Verify tests pass
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run full test suite and manual testing
5. Complete essential Polish tasks (T045-T056 for deployment)

**MVP Delivers**: OAuth2 authorization endpoint with agent validation and consent checking, **fully tested** with unit and integration tests

### Incremental Delivery (TDD for Each Story)

After MVP (US1), add stories incrementally with TDD:

1. **US1 → Deploy**: Authorization endpoint functional and tested
2. **Add US2 with TDD** (T028-T034): Write token tests → Implement → Verify → Deploy
3. **Add US3 with TDD** (T035-T041): Write metadata tests → Implement → Verify → Deploy
4. **Add E2E tests** (T042-T044): Complete end-to-end validation

### Parallel Team Strategy with TDD

With multiple developers or agents:

1. **Phase 1-2 (Setup + Foundation)**: Assign to golang-pro to establish baseline with tests (T001-T013)
2. **Once Phase 2 complete, split user stories with TDD**:
   - **US1 (Authorization)**: golang-pro agent
     - First: Write tests T014-T018
     - Then: Implement T019-T027
   - **US2 (Token)**: backend-developer agent
     - First: Write tests T028-T030
     - Then: Implement T031-T034
   - **US3 (Metadata)**: api-designer agent
     - First: Write tests T035-T037
     - Then: Implement T038-T041
3. **Polish Phase**: Add E2E tests (qa-expert), documentation (technical-writer), security review (security-engineer)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3) for traceability
- **⚠️ TDD CRITICAL**: Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation per Constitution Principle VIII
- **Test verification**: After writing tests, run them to verify they FAIL before implementing code
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- **US1 is MVP** - provides core authorization flow with consent checking, fully tested
- **US2 completes the flow** - adds token exchange capability with tests
- **US3 enhances DX** - adds metadata discovery with tests
- Run the verification gate at each checkpoint: `just verify`
- Verify configuration validation, TLS security, and error handling at each checkpoint
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently with automated tests

---
