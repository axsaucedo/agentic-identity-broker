# Feature Specification: Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD) Support

**Feature Branch**: `026-cimd-support`
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Status**: Draft
**Spec**: [draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent Authenticates with URL-Based Client ID (Priority: P1)

An AI agent identifies itself to the authorization server by using its own HTTPS URL as the `client_id` value in an authorization request. The operator has pre-registered that URL on the corresponding Agent record. The authorization server resolves the Agent, fetches the metadata document at the `client_id` URL, validates it, and uses the contained metadata (name, redirect URIs, logo) to drive the consent screen.

**Why this priority**: This is the core capability of the feature. All other stories depend on the broker successfully fetching, validating, and presenting CIMD-sourced agent metadata.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a valid HTTPS URL `client_id` in an authorization request to a live broker instance backed by a mock CIMD endpoint, and verifying the consent screen renders metadata from the document.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid CIMD document is served at `https://agent.example.com/client`, **When** an authorization request arrives with `client_id=https://agent.example.com/client`, **Then** the broker fetches the document, validates the `client_id` field matches, and presents `client_name` and `redirect_uris` from the document on the consent screen.
2. **Given** the CIMD document's `client_id` field does not exactly match the request URL, **When** the broker fetches the document, **Then** the authorization request is rejected with an error indicating client metadata mismatch.
3. **Given** the CIMD document is absent or returns a non-200 HTTP status, **When** the broker attempts to fetch it, **Then** the authorization request is rejected and no redirect is issued.
4. **Given** the authorization request uses a `redirect_uri` not listed in the CIMD document, **When** the redirect URI is validated after authorization, **Then** the request is rejected.

---

### User Story 2 - SSRF-Hardened Fetcher Blocks Malicious URLs (Priority: P1)

An operator needs confidence that accepting untrusted HTTPS URLs as `client_id` values cannot be weaponized to make the broker perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) against internal infrastructure. The CIMD fetcher must proactively reject URLs targeting private networks, loopback addresses, and link-local IP ranges (including cloud metadata endpoints such as 169.254.169.254) before any network connection is established.

**Why this priority**: Without SSRF protection, any external party can craft a `client_id` URL that causes the broker to probe internal services. This is a critical pre-condition for enabling CIMD at all.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending authorization requests whose `client_id` points to blocked IP ranges (loopback, RFC 1918 private, link-local) and verifying each is rejected before a DNS lookup or TCP connection is made.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a `client_id` URL whose hostname resolves to a private IP range (10.x, 172.16–31.x, 192.168.x), **When** the broker validates the URL, **Then** the request is rejected without issuing any outbound connection.
2. **Given** a `client_id` URL whose hostname resolves to a loopback address (127.x or ::1), **When** the broker validates the URL, **Then** the request is rejected.
3. **Given** a `client_id` URL whose hostname resolves to a link-local address (169.254.x.x or fe80::/10, including cloud metadata endpoints such as 169.254.169.254), **When** the broker validates the URL, **Then** the request is rejected.
4. **Given** a `client_id` URL using an HTTP (non-HTTPS) scheme, **When** the broker receives the request, **Then** the request is rejected immediately without a network call.
5. **Given** a `client_id` URL with a path containing single or double dot segments (`../`), **When** the URL is parsed, **Then** the request is rejected due to invalid client ID format.
6. **Given** a CIMD endpoint that streams a response larger than the configured size limit, **When** the broker fetches the document, **Then** the download is aborted and the request is rejected.
7. **Given** a CIMD endpoint that does not respond within the configured timeout, **When** the broker waits, **Then** the connection is terminated and the request is rejected.

---

### User Story 3 - CIMD Response Caching Reduces Latency (Priority: P2)

For repeated authorization requests from the same agent, the broker caches the previously fetched CIMD document according to HTTP cache semantics (ETag, Cache-Control, Expires), avoiding a network round-trip on every request while respecting operator-configured minimum and maximum TTL bounds.

**Why this priority**: Without caching, every authorization request triggers a network fetch to an external host, adding latency and creating a dependency on the CIMD host's availability. Caching makes the system resilient and performant.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by issuing two sequential authorization requests for the same URL-based `client_id` and verifying the second request does not trigger an outbound HTTP fetch (observable via mock server request counts or cache metrics).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CIMD document was successfully fetched and has a `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` header, **When** a second authorization request with the same `client_id` URL arrives within the TTL, **Then** the broker serves the cached document without a network call.
2. **Given** a cached CIMD document has expired (Cache-Control max-age elapsed), **When** an authorization request arrives, **Then** the broker re-fetches the document and refreshes the cache.
3. **Given** a CIMD fetch returns an error (non-200 status or network failure), **When** the broker evaluates caching, **Then** the error response is never cached and subsequent requests always retry the fetch.
4. **Given** operator configuration sets a maximum cache TTL shorter than the document's `max-age`, **When** the broker stores the document, **Then** the operator-configured TTL takes precedence.

---

### User Story 4 - Authorization Server Advertises CIMD Support (Priority: P3)

The authorization server's own metadata endpoint (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` or `/.well-known/openid-configuration`) includes `"client_id_metadata_document_supported": true`, signaling to well-behaved clients that URL-based `client_id` values are accepted, preventing them from sending users to incompatible servers.

**Why this priority**: Provides standard interoperability signaling. Agents can check this field before initiating a flow. Lower priority because the feature works without it, but it is required for spec compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by fetching the broker's authorization server metadata document and asserting the field is present and `true` when CIMD support is enabled, and absent (or `false`) when disabled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** CIMD support is enabled in broker configuration, **When** a client fetches the authorization server metadata, **Then** the response includes `"client_id_metadata_document_supported": true`.
2. **Given** CIMD support is disabled in broker configuration, **When** a client fetches the authorization server metadata, **Then** the field is absent or `false`.

---

### User Story 5 - CIMD-Enhanced Consent Screen (Priority: P1)

When a user arrives at the consent screen for an Agent identified by a Client ID Metadata Document URL, the screen must communicate clearly who is requesting access, where credentials will be sent, and surface a prominent warning for localhost redirects — giving the user enough information to make an informed consent decision without needing to inspect raw OAuth parameters.

**Why this priority**: The consent screen is the primary user-facing trust boundary. Without explicit display of redirect destination and domain verification, users cannot detect phishing or misdirected consent flows. Elevated to P1 because it is the security-critical companion to the CIMD fetch and validation flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering the consent screen for a CIMD-based authorization request in isolation and asserting each required UI element is present with the correct content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CIMD-based authorization request with a non-localhost `redirect_uri`, **When** the consent screen is rendered, **Then** it displays: (a) summary "The application [client_name] wants to access [Access Target].", (b) "Verified domain: [hostname]", and (c) a collapsed "Advanced Details" section.
2. **Given** a CIMD-based authorization request whose `redirect_uri` resolves to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, **When** the consent screen is rendered, **Then** a prominent warning is displayed: "This app is requesting a redirect to your local machine. Ensure you started this request from [Agent.DisplayName]."
3. **Given** the "Advanced Details" section is collapsed, **When** the user expands it, **Then** it reveals: Client Name, Client ID, Redirect URI, and Requested Scopes.
4. **Given** a brand mismatch has been detected (CIMD `client_name` differs from `Agent.DisplayName`), **When** the consent screen is rendered, **Then** the displayed `client_name` is the CIMD value and the mismatch audit event has already been logged before the screen is shown.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the CIMD URL contains query parameters? (Per spec: discouraged but permitted; query parameters must not alter the document identity check.)
- What happens when DNS resolution for the CIMD hostname succeeds but returns multiple A records — some safe, some blocked? (All resolved addresses must be checked; any blocked address causes rejection.)
- What happens when a CIMD document omits `redirect_uris`? (Authorization request is rejected; `redirect_uris` is mandatory for the flow to proceed.)
- What happens when a CIMD document's `token_endpoint_auth_method` specifies a client-secret-based method (`client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic`, `client_secret_jwt`)? (Rejected; these methods are incompatible with URL-based client IDs per spec.)
- What happens when a brand mismatch is detected (current `client_name` differs from `Agent.DisplayName`)? (Authorization flow continues; mismatch is logged as a structured audit event per FR-023a — blocking is not automatic.)
- What happens when `redirect_uris` or `token_endpoint_auth_method` change between fetches? (A structured audit event is emitted per SR-011; the authorization flow continues. No blocking occurs.)
- What happens when `jwks_uri` changes between fetches? (Authorization flow continues; a structured audit event is emitted per SR-012. No blocking occurs for JWKS URI rotation alone.)
- What happens when a CIMD document's `client_name` matches a blacklisted keyword? (Document is rejected per FR-023b; the authorization request fails with an error, no redirect is issued.)
- What happens when the broker is configured with an empty SSRF blocklist override? (Default RFC 6890 blocklist is always enforced regardless of operator configuration; it cannot be disabled.)
- What happens during a CIMD cache eviction under memory pressure? (Document is treated as expired; next request triggers a re-fetch.)
- What happens when a `client_id` URL has a non-443 port? (Always rejected; port 443 is the only permitted port.)
- What happens when a Client ID Metadata Document URL matches pre-registered entries in more than one Agent? (Ambiguous match — request is rejected; operator must ensure pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs are unique across all agents.)
- What happens when a Client ID Metadata Document URL is not pre-registered under any Agent? (Request is rejected per FR-027; clients presenting an unregistered Client ID Metadata Document URL are not permitted.)
- What happens when a CIMD document declares a `redirect_uri` on a different origin than the `client_id` URL (e.g. a CDN or a partner domain)? (Rejected per FR-004a; cross-origin redirect URIs are not permitted, with the sole exception of localhost/127.0.0.1.)
- What happens when a CIMD document declares a `redirect_uri` of `http://localhost:3000` but the `client_id` URL is `https://agent.example.com/client`? (Permitted; localhost is an unconditional exception regardless of the client_id origin.)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept HTTPS URLs as `client_id` values in authorization requests when CIMD support is enabled.
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch the CIMD document at the `client_id` URL using a hardened HTTP client (SSRF-safe, timeout-bounded, size-limited).
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject any CIMD document where the `client_id` field does not exactly match the request URL (byte-for-byte string comparison).
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject authorization requests where the `redirect_uri` is not listed in the CIMD document's `redirect_uris` array.
- **FR-004a**: System MUST reject CIMD documents where any declared `redirect_uri` is not same-origin with the `client_id` URL (same scheme, host, and port), unless the `redirect_uri` host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (any port), which are always permitted to support locally-running agents.
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT follow HTTP redirects when fetching a CIMD document.
- **FR-006**: System MUST accept only HTTP 200 responses as valid CIMD documents; any other status code is treated as a fetch failure.
- **FR-007**: System MUST abort CIMD fetches that exceed the configured response size limit (default: 5,120 bytes).
- **FR-008**: System MUST abort CIMD fetches that exceed the configured total request timeout (default: 1 second).
- **FR-009**: System MUST resolve the CIMD URL's hostname to IP addresses and validate all resolved addresses against the SSRF blocklist before establishing a connection.
- **FR-010**: System MUST block CIMD fetch attempts targeting loopback addresses (IPv4 127.0.0.0/8 and IPv6 ::1/128).
- **FR-011**: System MUST block CIMD fetch attempts targeting private-use addresses (RFC 1918: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
- **FR-012**: System MUST block CIMD fetch attempts targeting link-local addresses (IPv4 169.254.0.0/16 and IPv6 fe80::/10).
- **FR-013**: System MUST block CIMD fetch attempts targeting any address in the RFC 6890 Special-Purpose Address Registry not already covered above.
- **FR-014**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs using any scheme other than `https`.
- **FR-014a**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs that have no path component (i.e. the URL ends immediately after the host or port with no `/` and path).
- **FR-015**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs containing path segments composed solely of `.` or `..` (dot and double-dot).
- **FR-016**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs containing fragment identifiers (`#`).
- **FR-017**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs containing embedded credentials (userinfo in the authority component).
- **FR-018**: System MUST reject `client_id` URLs using ports other than 443.
- **FR-019**: System MUST cache successfully fetched CIMD documents according to HTTP cache semantics (ETag, Cache-Control, Expires), subject to operator-configured minimum and maximum TTL bounds.
- **FR-020**: System MUST NOT cache CIMD fetch errors or malformed documents.
- **FR-021**: System MUST include `"client_id_metadata_document_supported": true` in authorization server metadata when CIMD is enabled.
- **FR-022**: System MUST reject CIMD documents that specify a `token_endpoint_auth_method` of `client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic`, or `client_secret_jwt`.
- **FR-023**: System MUST present `client_name` and `logo_uri` from the CIMD document on the consent screen; when `client_name` is absent, the pre-provisioned `Agent.DisplayName` MUST be displayed instead.
- **FR-023a**: System MUST enforce Brand Pinning on `client_name` only: when a CIMD document is fetched and matched to an Agent, the document's `client_name` MUST be compared to `Agent.DisplayName`. If the values differ, a structured mismatch event MUST be logged including the Agent ID, `Agent.DisplayName`, and the CIMD `client_name`. The authorization flow continues regardless of mismatch. `logo_uri` is displayed as-is without brand-pin validation.
- **FR-023b**: System MUST validate the CIMD document's `client_name` against a blacklist of reserved and system-level keywords (e.g. "admin", "system", "operator", names of identity providers) before accepting the document. A document whose `client_name` matches a blacklisted term MUST be rejected with an appropriate error.
- **FR-023c**: The keyword blacklist MUST be operator-configurable (additions); a non-empty default set of reserved terms MUST be enforced regardless of operator configuration.
- **FR-024**: SSRF protection MUST be enabled by default and MUST NOT be configurable to fully disable; operators may only extend (not replace) the default blocklist.
- **FR-025**: The `Agent` entity MUST be extended with: (a) a list of pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs; and (b) `authMethod` and `jwksURI` fields storing the last observed values from the CIMD document (the existing `redirectURIs` field serves the same role). These fields act as the change-detection baseline for SR-011 and SR-012: each successful fetch compares incoming values against the stored fields, emits an audit event on any difference, then updates the fields. Both additions require a database migration.
- **FR-026**: When processing an authorization request whose `client_id` is a Client ID Metadata Document URL, the broker MUST attempt an exact-match lookup of that URL against each Agent's pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs; if a match is found, that Agent record is the pre-registered client used for consent grouping.
- **FR-027**: If a Client ID Metadata Document URL matches no Agent's pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs, the authorization request MUST be rejected; clients presenting an unregistered Client ID Metadata Document URL are not permitted.

### Consent Screen Requirements

- **CS-001**: The consent screen for CIMD-based clients MUST display a summary statement: *"The application [client_name] wants to access [Access Target]."* where `[Access Target]` is the name of the requested third-party service and/or the human-readable scope list.
- **CS-002**: The consent screen MUST display a domain verification badge: *"Verified domain: [hostname]"* derived from the Client ID Metadata Document URL's hostname, confirming the domain is pre-registered.
- **CS-003**: When the `redirect_uri` host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, the consent screen MUST display a prominent warning: *"This app is requesting a redirect to your local machine. Ensure you started this request from [Agent.DisplayName]."* where `[Agent.DisplayName]` is the pre-registered Agent name.
- **CS-004**: The consent screen MUST include an unfoldable "Advanced Details" section, collapsed by default, that reveals the following fields: Client Name (`client_name` from CIMD document), Client ID (the `client_id` URL), Redirect URI (the requested `redirect_uri`), Requested Scopes.

### Domain Model

**Domain Entity Diagram**:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ClientIDMetadataDocument {
        string clientID PK
        string clientName
        string logoURI
        string[] redirectURIs
        string authMethod
        string[] grantTypes
        string[] responseTypes
        string jwksURI
        string policyURI
        string tosURI
    }
    CIMDCacheEntry {
        string url PK
        ClientIDMetadataDocument document
        timestamp fetchedAt
        timestamp expiresAt
        string etag
    }
    ClientIDMetadataDocument ||--o| CIMDCacheEntry : "cached as"
```

**CIMD Authorization Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Agent
    participant AuthServer as Authorization Server
    participant SSRFGuard as SSRF Guard
    participant Fetcher as CIMD Fetcher
    participant Cache as CIMD Cache
    participant CIMDHost as Agent CIMD Host

    Agent->>AuthServer: GET /authorize?client_id=https://agent.example/client&...
    AuthServer->>SSRFGuard: validate URL (scheme, path, DNS resolution)
    SSRFGuard-->>AuthServer: OK or blocked
    AuthServer->>Cache: lookup https://agent.example/client
    alt Cache hit (not expired)
        Cache-->>AuthServer: ClientIDMetadataDocument
    else Cache miss or expired
        AuthServer->>Fetcher: fetch(url, timeout=1s, maxBytes=5120)
        Fetcher->>CIMDHost: GET https://agent.example/client
        CIMDHost-->>Fetcher: 200 OK + JSON (≤5KB)
        Fetcher-->>AuthServer: raw document
        AuthServer->>AuthServer: validate client_id field match
        AuthServer->>Cache: store with TTL from Cache-Control
    end
    AuthServer->>Agent: render consent screen with client_name / hostname
```

**Agent Entity Extension** (from `025-oauth2-server`, extended for CIMD):

The existing `Agent` entity is extended with a list of pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs `client_uris` — set by the operator during Client ID Metadata Document URL pre-registration. When an incoming `client_id` URL exactly matches an entry in this list, the broker resolves the Agent record as the pre-registered client for consent grouping.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Agent {
        uuid id PK
        string clientID
        string displayName
        string[] redirectURIs
        string[] client_uris
        string authMethod
        string jwksURI
    }
```

**Entities** (things with unique identity):
- **ClientIDMetadataDocument**: The JSON document served at the agent's `client_id` URL. Identity is the `client_id` field value (the URL itself). Contains display metadata and OAuth2 parameters for a dynamically-registered-style client. Lifecycle: fetched on demand, cached, re-fetched on cache expiry. Key invariant: `client_id` field must match the URL it was fetched from.
- **CIMDCacheEntry**: A stored fetch result binding a URL to its document and caching metadata (ETag, expiry). Evicted on TTL expiry or memory pressure.

**Value Objects** (things without identity):
- **ClientIDMetadataDocumentURL**: An `https://` URL used as a `client_id`. Validated at parse time: must be HTTPS, no fragment, no credentials, no dot-segments, and hostname must resolve to a non-blocked address.
- **SSRFBlocklist**: The ordered set of CIDR ranges and address categories that are always rejected. Immutable at runtime; operator-provided additions are merged at startup.

**Domain Events** (state changes of business significance):
- **CIMDDocumentFetched**: Emitted when a document is successfully fetched and cached. Includes URL, cache TTL, and `client_name`.
- **CIMDFetchBlocked**: Emitted when a fetch attempt is rejected by the SSRF guard. Includes URL and the reason (blocked IP range, invalid scheme, etc.).
- **CIMDFetchFailed**: Emitted when the remote host returns a non-200 response, times out, or returns an oversized body.
- **BrandPinMismatchDetected**: Emitted when the CIMD document's `client_name` differs from `Agent.DisplayName`. Includes Agent ID, `Agent.DisplayName`, and the CIMD `client_name`. The authorization flow continues.
- **CIMDSecurityFieldChanged**: Emitted when `redirect_uris`, `token_endpoint_auth_method`, or `jwks_uri` changes between fetches (per SR-011/SR-012). Includes Agent ID, field name, previous value, new value, and timestamp. The authorization flow continues.

### Configuration Requirements

**Configuration Parameters** (nested under `oauth2_authorization_server`):
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.enabled`**: bool, enables CIMD support globally, default `false`
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.fetch_timeout`**: duration, total HTTP round-trip timeout, default `1s`
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.max_response_bytes`**: int, maximum CIMD document size in bytes, default `5120`
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.cache.max_ttl`**: duration, upper bound on document cache TTL, default `1h`
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.cache.min_ttl`**: duration, lower bound on document cache TTL (prevents hammering), default `60s`
- **`oauth2_authorization_server.cimd.ssrf.extra_blocked_cidrs`**: []string, operator-added CIDR ranges to block in addition to defaults

**Example YAML Configuration**:
```yaml
oauth2_authorization_server:
  # ... existing fields ...
  cimd:
    enabled: true
    fetch_timeout: 1s
    max_response_bytes: 5120
    cache:
      max_ttl: 1h
      min_ttl: 60s
    ssrf:
      extra_blocked_cidrs: []
```

**Configuration Location**: Added to `internal/ports/config.go` as `CIMDConfig` struct embedded in `OAuth2AuthServerConfig`, and documented in `examples/config/`.

### API Requirements

- **API-001**: The authorization server metadata endpoint (`GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) MUST include `"client_id_metadata_document_supported": true` when `cimd.enabled` is `true`.
- **API-002**: The existing `GET /authorize` and `POST /token` end-user endpoints accept URL-based `client_id` values without schema change; CIMD lookup is transparent.
- **API-003**: A structured error response using OAuth2 `error` / `error_description` fields MUST be returned for all CIMD validation failures (invalid URL format, SSRF block, fetch failure, document mismatch, blocked auth method). No redirect is issued on these errors.

### Security Requirements

- **SR-001**: SSRF protection MUST be enabled by default; it MUST NOT be possible to fully disable it via configuration.
- **SR-002**: All resolved IP addresses for a CIMD hostname MUST be checked against the blocklist before any TCP connection is opened (DNS TOCTOU protection: resolve once, validate, connect only to the validated address).
- **SR-003**: The CIMD fetcher MUST enforce a hard maximum on response body size (default 5,120 bytes) and abort mid-stream if the limit is reached; the response MUST NOT be buffered past this limit.
- **SR-004**: The CIMD fetcher MUST enforce a total request timeout (connect + read); default 1 second. Each phase (DNS, TCP connect, TLS handshake, response read) contributes to this single budget.
- **SR-005**: HTTP redirects MUST NOT be followed during CIMD fetch. A redirect response MUST be treated the same as a non-200 error.
- **SR-006**: TLS certificate validation MUST be enforced for all CIMD fetches; there MUST be no configuration option to skip certificate verification.
- **SR-007**: CIMD fetch failures (SSRF block, timeout, oversized body, TLS error, non-200 response) MUST emit structured audit log events including the URL, failure reason, and timestamp.
- **SR-008**: The `client_id` field in the CIMD document MUST be compared to the fetch URL using exact byte-for-byte string comparison; normalization or case folding MUST NOT be applied.
- **SR-009**: CIMD documents that specify client-secret-based `token_endpoint_auth_method` values MUST be rejected at validation time, not silently ignored.
- **SR-010**: Any URL field within a fetched CIMD document (`logo_uri`, `jwks_uri`, `policy_uri`, `tos_uri`) that the broker resolves or fetches MUST be validated against the same SSRF blocklist as the `client_id` URL itself before any outbound connection is made. A document containing a blocked URL in any such field MUST be logged but need not be rejected outright; the offending field is silently ignored.
- **SR-011**: On each successful CIMD document fetch, the broker MUST compare the current values of `redirect_uris` and `token_endpoint_auth_method` against the snapshot persisted on the Agent record from the previous fetch. If either field has changed, the broker MUST emit a structured audit event recording the previous and new values, Agent ID, and timestamp. The authorization flow continues regardless. The first successful fetch for a given Agent populates the snapshot without triggering an audit event.
- **SR-012**: On each successful CIMD document fetch, the broker MUST compare the current `jwks_uri` value against the snapshot persisted on the Agent record. If it has changed, a structured audit event MUST be emitted (previous URI, new URI, timestamp, Agent ID); the authorization flow is NOT blocked for `jwks_uri` changes alone. The Agent record snapshot is updated on every fetch.

### Key Entities

- **ClientIDMetadataDocument**: Represents an agent's self-described OAuth2 metadata, fetched from the agent's own HTTPS endpoint. Key attributes: `client_id` (URL), `client_name`, `redirect_uris`, `token_endpoint_auth_method`, `logo_uri`. Immutable after fetch; a new fetch produces a new value.
- **CIMDCacheEntry**: Stores a fetched document alongside its HTTP caching metadata (ETag, expiry timestamp). Scoped to the broker process; not persisted to the database.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: An AI agent using a URL-based `client_id` completes an authorization flow (fetch → consent → token) in under 2 seconds total when the CIMD host responds within 500ms, as measured end-to-end in E2E tests.
- **SC-002**: All 14 SSRF attack categories (loopback, RFC 1918, link-local, cloud metadata IP, non-HTTPS scheme, no path component, dot-segment path, fragment, credentials in URL, non-standard port, oversized response, slow-response timeout, redirect following, non-200 status) are each individually rejected before any TCP connection is established, verified by E2E tests.
- **SC-003**: A repeated authorization request for the same URL-based `client_id` within the cache TTL window completes without issuing a second outbound HTTP fetch, as verified by mock server request counts in E2E tests.
- **SC-004**: Zero regression in existing authorization flows using opaque (pre-registered) `client_id` values, verified by the full existing E2E test suite passing without modification.
- **SC-005**: The authorization server metadata endpoint correctly reflects `client_id_metadata_document_supported` status in all configuration states, verified by E2E tests.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-04-22

- Q: How does a Client ID Metadata Document URL identify which Agent record it belongs to? → A: The operator pre-registers Client ID Metadata Document URLs on the Agent entity during Agent provisioning; the broker maps an incoming `client_id` URL to an Agent by exact lookup against that Agent's pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs.
- Q: What constitutes a match between a `client_id` URL and a pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URL? → A: Exact match only — the `client_id` URL must equal the pre-registered URL character-for-character.
- Terminology: Per the CIMD draft RFC, domain language is used throughout this spec. The act of adding URLs to an Agent is called "pre-registering Client ID Metadata Document URLs". The field on Agent is "pre-registered Client ID Metadata Document URLs". "Unregistered" describes a `client_id` URL that has not been pre-registered.
- Consent screen UX: Five explicit requirements added (CS-001 through CS-005): summary statement with access target, redirect URI destination statement, verified domain badge, localhost redirect warning (referencing Agent.DisplayName), and a collapsed Advanced Details section showing Client Name, Client ID, Redirect URI, and Requested Scopes.
- Q: Which authority governs the acceptable `redirect_uri` values for a client identified by a Client ID Metadata Document URL? → A: Same-origin as the `client_id` URL (scheme + host + port); `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are always permitted regardless of origin to support locally-running tooling and coding agents.
- Q: Which metadata drives the consent screen when a CIMD document resolves to an Agent? → A: CIMD document metadata (`client_name`, `logo_uri`) is displayed to show current app branding. Brand Pinning is enforced: the CIMD `client_name` is compared against `Agent.DisplayName` (set by the operator at provisioning); a mismatch is logged as an audit event but does not block the flow. The `client_name` is also validated against a blacklist of reserved/system-level keywords to prevent spoofing.
- Q: Where is the Brand Pin baseline stored, and what is it anchored to? → A: The pin IS `Agent.DisplayName` — already persisted on the Agent record. No new baseline storage is required. Only `client_name` is subject to brand pinning (not `logo_uri`).
- RFC security gap review applied: (1) Added FR-014a requiring path component in `client_id` URL. (2) Added SR-010 requiring SSRF validation for all URLs embedded within the CIMD document. (3) Documented `logo_uri` prefetching as a known deferred security tradeoff. (4) Q: Scope of metadata change monitoring beyond `client_name` → A: Log-only for all three security-critical fields (`redirect_uris`, `token_endpoint_auth_method`, `jwks_uri`); no blocking on any field change. Authorization flow continues regardless.
- Q: Where is the previously-observed CIMD snapshot stored for SR-011/SR-012 change detection? → A: The Agent entity's own `redirectURIs`, `authMethod`, and `jwksURI` fields serve as the snapshot — updated on every successful CIMD fetch. No separate snapshot columns are required; the stored Agent state IS the baseline. Persisted in the database; survives restarts and is consistent across replicas.

## Assumptions

- CIMD support will be implemented as an opt-in capability (`cimd.enabled: false` by default), consistent with the constitution's security-first principle.
- The cache layer is in-process memory only (no Redis or DB persistence required); cache is lost on broker restart.
- Existing Agents with opaque (non-URL) `client_id` values are unaffected; the broker distinguishes a Client ID Metadata Document URL from an opaque `client_id` by the `https://` prefix.
- The consent screen renders `client_name` and `logo_uri` from the CIMD document; `logo_uri` is displayed as a URL reference (no server-side pre-fetching or proxying in this implementation). **Known security tradeoff**: the RFC recommends server-side prefetching and caching of `logo_uri` to (a) prevent dynamic logo substitution attacks that could confuse users, and (b) prevent cross-domain tracking via logo requests from users' browsers. This is deferred to a follow-on spec. The consent screen also includes all five CIMD-specific UX elements defined in CS-001 through CS-005.
- Port 443 is the only default allowed port; this is not expected to need operator customization in practice.
- `Agent.DisplayName` serves as the Brand Pin baseline; no new storage or first-fetch recording logic is required.
- The operator-configurable keyword blacklist augments a non-empty built-in default set; the exact default terms are defined during implementation.
