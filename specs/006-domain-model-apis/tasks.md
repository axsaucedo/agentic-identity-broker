## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation, architecture compliance, and final improvements
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependency**: All user stories must be complete

### Constitution Compliance (MANDATORY)

- [ ] T106 Verify user APIs (port 8000) are protected via session middleware extracting principal
- [ ] T107 Verify client secrets are redacted in all GET responses
- [ ] T108 Verify principal validation prevents cross-user access on grant endpoints
- [ ] T109 Verify cascade delete works when agent is deleted (grants deleted)
- [ ] T110 Verify service deletion blocked when grants reference it (409 Conflict response)

### API Documentation

- [ ] T111 [P] Create admin API documentation in `docs/api/admin-apis.md` - agents and OAuth2 services endpoints
- [ ] T112 [P] Create user consent API documentation in `docs/api/consent-apis.md` - agent info and grants endpoints
- [ ] T113 [P] Generate API documentation from OpenAPI spec in `specs/006-domain-model-apis/contracts/openapi.yaml`
- [ ] T114 Update main docs/configuration.md to include domain model configuration section for encryption and storage backends

- [ ] T117 [P] Run all integration tests with testcontainers PostgreSQL
- [ ] T118 Verify error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes (201 created, 204 no content, 400 bad request, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 500 server error)
- [ ] T119 Verify structured audit logging for all user story operations (grant creation, agent CRUD, service CRUD)
- [ ] T120 Run gofmt, go vet, and golangci-lint checks on all new code

### End-to-End Validation

- [ ] T124 Test agent deletion cascade deletes grants
- [ ] T125 Test principal isolation (user A cannot access user B's grants)
- [ ] T126 Test concurrent grant modifications by same user (upsert semantics work correctly)
- [ ] T127 Validate all response schemas match OpenAPI spec in contracts/openapi.yaml

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete - All user stories delivered, documented, and production-ready

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3, P1)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP scope
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4, P1)**: Depends on Foundational - can run parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5, P2)**: Depends on Foundational, US1, US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6, P3)**: Depends on Foundational, US1, US2, US3
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories

### Parallel Opportunities

**After Phase 2 (Foundational) completion**:
- US1 and US2 can be worked on in parallel (different files, independent stories)
- Within US1: All in-memory tests → PostgreSQL tests → handlers can be pipelined
- Within US2: Discovery service → In-memory repo → PostgreSQL repo → handlers can be pipelined
- US3 cannot start until US1 and US2 are complete (needs both agents and services)
- US4 cannot start until US1, US2, and US3 are complete (needs all prerequisites)

**Parallel Example: Teams with Multiple Developers**

```
Setup Phase (1-2 hours): 1 person
  ↓
Foundational Phase (8-10 hours): Whole team together
  ↓
Once Foundational complete:
  Developer A: User Story 1 (4-5 hours)
  Developer B: User Story 2 (6-8 hours) - runs in parallel with A
  (When A+B done):
  Developer C: User Story 3 (2-3 hours)
  (When A+B+C done):
  Developer D: User Story 4 (5-7 hours)
  (When all done):
  Whole team: Polish & cross-cutting (2-3 hours)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended for Initial Release)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (1-2 hours)
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (8-10 hours) ← **Critical milestone**
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Agent Registry (4-5 hours)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with admin endpoints
5. **Deploy MVP**: Agent management functionality ready
6. **Add Phase 4**: User Story 2 - OAuth2 Services (6-8 hours)
7. **Add Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Consent Info (2-3 hours)
8. **Add Phase 6**: User Story 4 - User Grants (5-7 hours)

### Incremental Delivery Timeline

- **Week 1**: Setup + Foundational (9-12 hours total)
- **Week 2**: User Story 1 + US2 in parallel (10-13 hours total)
- **Week 3**: User Story 3 + US4 in parallel (7-10 hours total)
- **Week 4**: Polish & cross-cutting concerns (2-3 hours)

### Work in Parallel (With Team)

With 4 developers:
- Developer 1 + 2: Complete Setup + Foundational together
- Developer 3: Start US1 when Foundational done
- Developer 4: Start US2 when Foundational done
- Once US1+US2 done: All continue with US3, then US4
- Final week: All hands on Polish phase

## Notes & Best Practices

- **Task Independence**: Each task should be completable without waiting for other tasks (except explicit dependencies)
- **File Isolation**: [P] tasks use different files to enable parallel execution
- **Test First**: Consider writing tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- **Story Checkpoints**: Stop and validate after each user story before moving to next
- **Commit Frequently**: One commit per task or logical group (~10 tasks per commit)
- **Verify Tests**: Run tests after each phase before proceeding to next phase
- **Error Prevention**: Avoid vague tasks, cross-file conflicts, or implicit dependencies
- **MVP Validation**: Complete at least through Phase 3 (US1) before declaring MVP ready
