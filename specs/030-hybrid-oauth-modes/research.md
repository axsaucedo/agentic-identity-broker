# Research: Hybrid OAuth Server Modes

**Feature**: 030-hybrid-oauth-modes | **Date**: 2026-05-12

## R1: Mode Strategy — Domain vs Adapter Boundary

**Decision**: Split mode concerns into two layers:

1. **Domain layer** (`internal/domain/oauth2/`): `ModeStrategy` with `AcceptsClass(AgentClass) bool`. Three implementations (proxy, local, hybrid) — all pure domain logic. This determines whether a classified agent is permitted in the active mode.

2. **Adapter layer** (`internal/adapters/http/enduser/`): Dispatching proceed/grant strategies for hybrid mode. These wrap both proxy and local proceed/grant strategies and delegate based on agent class. This is HTTP adapter code, wired by the builder.

**Rationale**: Accept/reject is domain logic — it depends only on agent class, not HTTP. Dispatching between proxy and local HTTP strategies is adapter code — it selects which HTTP handler path to follow. Keeping these separate ensures domain never references HTTP adapters, satisfying hexagonal architecture rules.

The builder uses the domain `ModeStrategy` to validate config at startup and wires the appropriate adapter strategies:
- `proxy` mode → proxy proceed + proxy grant strategies (existing)
- `local` mode → local proceed + local grant strategies (existing, renamed from issueToken)
- `hybrid` mode → dispatching proceed + dispatching grant strategies (new, delegate based on `agent.Class()`)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single `ModeStrategy` interface spanning both accept/reject and dispatch — rejected because it forces domain code to know about HTTP proceed/grant strategies
- Port interface in `internal/ports/` — rejected because nothing external implements it; all implementations are internal domain logic
- Single strategy with mode field + runtime branching in handlers — rejected per FR-014

## R2: Agent Classification Location

**Decision**: Classification is a method on the Agent entity: `agent.Class() AgentClass`. The `AgentClass` type is defined in `internal/domain/storage/` alongside the Agent entity.

**Rationale**: Classification derives entirely from Agent's own fields (`ClientID`, `ClientURIs`). It's natural to ask an agent "what class are you?" rather than passing the agent to an external classifier. The Agent entity already lives in domain code (`internal/domain/storage/`), so this keeps the logic co-located with the data it inspects.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Free function `ClassifyAgent(agent)` in `internal/domain/oauth2/` — rejected because it separates logic from the data it operates on; classification is intrinsic to the entity
- Classification in HTTP handler — rejected because it's domain logic, not HTTP concern

## R3: Config Restructuring Approach

**Decision**: Restructure `OAuth2AuthServerConfig` to have nested `Proxy` and `Local` sections. Mode validation ensures only relevant sections are populated. The flat fields (`UpstreamIssuerURI`, `TokenTTL`, etc.) move into their respective subsections.

**Rationale**: The spec requires each mode to have a dedicated config section (FR-015). Hybrid mode requires both sections (FR-016). Nested sections make cross-mode field ambiguity impossible at the structural level.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep flat structure with mode-based validation only — rejected because FR-015 explicitly requires dedicated sections per mode
- Separate config types per mode (union type) — adds complexity without benefit since Viper maps to a single struct

**Migration path**: Existing configs using flat fields (`upstream_issuer_uri` at top level) need to be updated. The `issue_token` → `local` rename happens in Phase 0 as a pure refactor.

## R4: Hybrid Mode Builder Wiring

**Decision**: In hybrid mode, the builder creates both local and proxy proceed/grant strategies, then wraps each pair in a dispatching strategy. The dispatching strategies live in `internal/adapters/http/enduser/` (adapter code) and use `agent.Class()` to delegate to the correct inner strategy per request.

**Rationale**: The builder already creates one strategy set or the other based on mode (`internal/app/builder.go:609-653`). For hybrid, both sets are created and wrapped. The dispatching strategies are adapter code because they select between HTTP handler paths — domain code is not involved in dispatch. Agent classification (`agent.Class()`) is the only domain call, and it returns a value object.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Two separate routers/mux for proxy and local paths — overengineered, requires URL path splitting that doesn't exist in the spec
- Domain-level dispatch — violates hexagonal architecture by making domain code aware of HTTP strategies

## R5: CIMD Agent UUID Rejection (FR-005)

**Decision**: Enforce in the client resolver: after resolving an agent by UUID, check if `len(agent.ClientURIs) > 0`. If so, reject with error "CIMD agents must be addressed via their URL-format client_id".

**Rationale**: FR-005 is explicit: UUID-format `client_id` resolving to a CIMD agent must be rejected. This prevents bypassing CIMD validation. The check belongs in the resolver since that's where resolution format and agent properties are both available.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Check in mode strategy — too late, classification should not run on improperly addressed agents
- Check in handler — domain logic belongs in domain layer

## R6: Deprecation Handling for `issue_token`

**Decision**: Config validation returns a clear error: `"mode 'issue_token' has been renamed to 'local' — please update your configuration"`. No silent fallback (SR-003).

**Rationale**: Explicit error with remediation guidance. The spec is clear: no silent migration.

## R7: ADR Decision

**Decision**: No new ADR. The spec, plan, and research documents already capture all architectural decisions (mode strategy pattern, agent classification, config restructuring, mode renaming). ADR 014 remains the binding ADR for local token issuance via fosite; this feature extends its patterns without changing the architectural foundation.

**Rationale**: An ADR would duplicate content already present in the spec artifacts. The spec + plan serve the same purpose — documenting decisions, rationale, and alternatives considered.
