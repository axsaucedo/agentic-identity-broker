# Implementation Tasks: Request Principal Extraction

**Feature**: Request Principal Extraction (Session Management)
**Branch**: `005-session-management`
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)

## Overview

This document breaks down the implementation of request principal extraction into executable tasks organized by user story priority. Each user story represents an independently testable increment of functionality.

**Tech Stack**:
- Go 1.24.0
- chi/v5 v5.2.3 (HTTP router)
- viper v1.21.0 (configuration)
- testify v1.11.1 (test assertions)
- slog (structured logging)

**Testing Approach**: Automated tests using Go standard library testing, testify for assertions, httptest for HTTP handler testing, table-driven tests for validation scenarios.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (P1) - Configure Principal Header
**Incremental Delivery**: Complete each user story independently before starting the next
**Parallel Opportunities**: Marked with [P] - tasks that can run concurrently on different files

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Goal**: Prepare project structure and foundational packages for principal extraction.

### Tasks

- [x] T001 Create internal/domain/principal package directory
- [x] T002 [P] Add authentication configuration types to internal/config/schema.go

**Completion Criteria**:
- Directory `internal/domain/principal/` exists
- `AuthenticationConfig`, `PreauthConfig` structs defined in schema.go

---

## Phase 2: Foundational

**Goal**: Implement core context utilities and error types that all user stories depend on.

### Tasks

- [x] T003 [P] Implement context key and WithPrincipal function in internal/domain/principal/context.go
- [x] T004 [P] Implement FromContext and MustFromContext functions in internal/domain/principal/context.go
- [x] T005 [P] Implement MissingPrincipalError and InvalidPrincipalError types in internal/domain/principal/errors.go
- [x] T006 Write unit tests for context utilities in internal/domain/principal/context_test.go
- [x] T007 [P] Write unit tests for error types in internal/domain/principal/errors_test.go

**Completion Criteria**:
- All context utility functions implemented and tested
- Context key is unexported type (type safety)
- All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- No external dependencies on user story code

**Blocking Dependencies**: None
**Blocks**: All user story implementations

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - Configure Principal Header

**Story**: A system administrator needs to configure the application to extract user principals from a specific HTTP header that their reverse proxy sets after authenticating users.

**Goal**: Enable configuration of principal header name with extensible structure supporting future JWT authentication.

**Independent Test**: Set configuration value and verify application loads it correctly at startup.

### Tasks

- [x] T008 [US1] Update ServerInstanceConfig with Authentication field in internal/config/schema.go
- [x] T009 [US1] Set default values for servers.*.authentication.preauth.principal_header_name in internal/config/loader.go
- [x] T010 [US1] Write unit tests for configuration defaults in internal/config/schema_test.go
- [x] T011 [US1] Write unit tests for configuration validation in internal/config/validator_test.go
- [x] T012 [US1] Add configuration validation for empty/invalid header names in internal/config/validator.go

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Configuration loaded with custom header name: `servers.admin.authentication.preauth.principal_header_name: "X-Authenticated-User"` → application uses "X-Authenticated-User"
- Configuration loaded with no header name → application uses default "X-Remote-User"
- Configuration loaded with empty header name → application logs error and uses default "X-Remote-User"
- Environment variable override works: `SERVERS_API_AUTHENTICATION_PREAUTH_PRINCIPAL_HEADER_NAME="X-Auth-User"` → application uses "X-Auth-User"

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Configuration schema updated with nested authentication structure
- ✅ Default values set for both admin and api servers
- ✅ Unit tests verify configuration loading
- ✅ Validation ensures non-empty header names
- ✅ Manual test: Update config.yaml and verify startup logs show correct header name

**Blocking Dependencies**: Phase 2 (Foundational)
**Independent**: Can be tested without middleware implementation

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2) - Extract Principal from Requests

**Story**: The application receives HTTP requests from a reverse proxy and needs to extract the authenticated user's principal (username) from the configured header to maintain user context throughout request processing.

**Goal**: Implement middleware to extract principals from headers and propagate via Go context.

**Independent Test**: Send HTTP requests with configured header and verify principal is extracted and available in request context.

### Tasks

- [x] T013 [P] [US2] Implement RequirePrincipalMiddleware factory function in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T014 [P] [US2] Implement OptionalPrincipalMiddleware factory function in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T015 [P] [US2] Implement writeErrorJSON helper function in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T016 [US2] Write table-driven unit tests for RequirePrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware_test.go
- [x] T017 [US2] Write table-driven unit tests for OptionalPrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware_test.go
- [x] T018 [US2] Update server.go to apply RequirePrincipalMiddleware to protected routes in internal/adapters/http/server.go
- [x] T019 [US2] Update server.go to apply OptionalPrincipalMiddleware to optional routes in internal/adapters/http/server.go
- [x] T020 [US2] Write integration tests with chi router in tests/integration/principal_middleware_test.go

**Test Scenarios** (from spec.md):
- Valid principal ("alice@example.com") → extracted and available in context
- Route without extraction → principal extraction skipped
- Multiple header values → first value used
- Leading/trailing whitespace → trimmed
- Unicode/emojis → preserved (UTF-8)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Request with header `X-Remote-User: alice@example.com` to protected route → principal "alice@example.com" in context, handler invoked
- Request without header to protected route → rejected with 401
- Request to route without extraction → handler invoked without principal
- Request with header `X-Remote-User:   alice   ` → principal "alice" in context (trimmed)
- Request with header containing emoji → principal preserved exactly

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ RequirePrincipalMiddleware implemented with validation
- ✅ OptionalPrincipalMiddleware implemented
- ✅ Table-driven tests cover all scenarios (9+ test cases)
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end extraction with chi router
- ✅ Manual test: curl request with principal header → logs show extracted principal

**Blocking Dependencies**: Phase 2 (Foundational), User Story 1 (configuration)
**Independent**: Can be tested with mock configuration without US3 validation logic

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 (P3) - Handle Missing or Invalid Principals

**Story**: The application needs to gracefully handle requests that don't contain a valid principal by rejecting them when principal extraction is enabled for a route.

**Goal**: Add defensive validation for edge cases and security enforcement.

**Independent Test**: Send requests without principal header or with invalid values to routes with extraction enabled, verify rejection with 401/400.

### Tasks

- [x] T021 [P] [US3] Add missing principal validation (401 response) to RequirePrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T022 [P] [US3] Add empty principal validation (401 response) to RequirePrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T023 [P] [US3] Add whitespace-only principal validation (401 response) to RequirePrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T024 [P] [US3] Add max length validation (400 response) to RequirePrincipalMiddleware in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware.go
- [x] T025 [US3] Write unit tests for missing principal scenarios in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware_test.go
- [x] T026 [US3] Write unit tests for invalid principal scenarios in internal/adapters/http/principal_middleware_test.go
- [x] T027 [US3] Write integration tests for edge cases in tests/integration/principal_middleware_test.go

**Test Scenarios** (from spec.md):
- Missing header → 401 Unauthorized
- Empty value → 401 Unauthorized
- Whitespace only (`"   "`) → 401 Unauthorized
- Principal > 200 characters → 400 Bad Request
- Route without extraction enabled → request proceeds normally

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Request without header to protected route → 401 with JSON `{"error": "missing or empty principal"}`
- Request with empty header value to protected route → 401 with JSON error
- Request with whitespace-only header to protected route → 401 with JSON error
- Request with 201-character principal to protected route → 400 with JSON `{"error": "principal exceeds maximum length of 200 characters"}`
- Request without header to public route → 200 OK (no validation)

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ All validation logic implemented (missing, empty, whitespace, max length)
- ✅ Error responses use consistent JSON structure
- ✅ Unit tests cover all edge cases
- ✅ Integration tests verify rejection behavior end-to-end
- ✅ Manual test: curl request with 201-char principal → 400 response

**Blocking Dependencies**: User Story 2 (middleware implementation)
**Independent**: Can be tested independently from other user stories
