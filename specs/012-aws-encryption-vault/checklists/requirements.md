  - 8 user stories (including environment variable story) with clear Given/When/Then scenarios

## Envelope Encryption Specificity

- [x] DEK explicitly defined - Data Encryption Keys for token encryption (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003)
- [x] KEK explicitly defined - Key Encryption Keys for DEK wrapping (FR-001, FR-004, FR-005)
- [x] Context binding at DEK level - Encryption context bound to both DEK encryption and KEK wrapping (FR-003, FR-004, FR-006)
- [x] Context fields explicit - Exactly four fields: principal, service_id, session_id, purpose (API-003)
- [x] Context verification at both layers - DEK decryption and KEK unwrapping both verify context (FR-006, FR-007)
- [x] Context mismatch causes failure - Context verification failures cause immediate decryption failure (SR-007, SR-027)
