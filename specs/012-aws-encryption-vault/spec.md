# Feature Specification: Encryption Vault for OAuth Tokens (Envelope Encryption)

**Feature Branch**: `012-aws-encryption-vault`
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Standard AWS Encryption Vault (PQC-Enabled by Go 1.24+)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Encrypt OAuth Tokens Using Envelope Encryption (Priority: P1)

A platform operator deploying the system to production needs to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens (access tokens, refresh tokens) stored in the sessions table using envelope encryption. Tokens should be encrypted at the application layer using a Data Encryption Key (DEK) before storage, with the DEK itself encrypted by a Key Encryption Key (KEK), providing two layers of protection. The encryption context (service_id) must be bound at the DEK level, ensuring tokens are tied to their specific service.

**Why this priority**: This is the core use case—protecting sensitive tokens at rest in the database using envelope encryption. Envelope encryption with DEK-level context binding provides defense in depth with the DEK and KEK managed separately.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by encrypting an OAuth token with envelope encryption (DEK with context + wrapped KEK), storing it in the sessions table, retrieving it, decrypting it with the correct KEK and context, and verifying the token is correctly recovered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a session with OAuth tokens and associated service_id context is stored, **When** tokens are saved to the sessions table, **Then** each token is encrypted using a DEK bound to its service context, the DEK is encrypted using a KEK with the same service context, and both the token ciphertext and wrapped DEK are stored
2. **Given** encrypted tokens and wrapped DEKs in the sessions table, **When** a session is retrieved and tokens are requested, **Then** the KEK is used to unwrap the DEK (verifying context), the DEK is used to decrypt the token (verifying context), and the plaintext token is returned
3. **Given** an attacker gains direct database access and reads encrypted tokens with wrapped DEKs, **When** they attempt to use the encrypted tokens with different context, **Then** the tokens are invalid because context verification fails at both DEK and KEK layers
4. **Given** a session is loaded from the database, **When** context verification fails at any layer, **Then** the application fails securely and does not fall back to plaintext tokens

---

### User Story 2 - Secure KEK Storage Using Industry Best Practices (Priority: P1)

A security team needs the Key Encryption Key (KEK) to be securely stored using industry-standard key management practices. For cloud deployments, KEKs should be managed by a centralized, enterprise-grade key management service. For development, KEKs may be stored locally with appropriate protections. Under no circumstances should KEKs exist in plaintext in application memory or on disk.

**Why this priority**: KEK security is fundamental to envelope encryption. Following industry best practices for KEK storage ensures the security of the entire token encryption system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring KEK storage, encrypting/decrypting tokens, and verifying that plaintext KEKs never appear in logs, memory, or on disk, and that all KEK operations are auditeable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production deployment with centralized key management configured, **When** a token is encrypted, **Then** the KEK is obtained from the key management service, used to wrap the DEK with context verification, and never stored in application memory or on disk
2. **Given** KEK access is configured with centralized key management, **When** tokens are decrypted, **Then** the key management service is called to unwrap the DEK (verifying context), and all KEK operations are logged by the key management service
3. **Given** access controls on the centralized key management service, **When** an unauthorized user's session attempts to decrypt tokens, **Then** the key management service denies KEK access and the application fails securely
4. **Given** keys are rotated in the centralized key management service, **When** tokens encrypted with a previous KEK version need decryption, **Then** the key management service can still decrypt them with the previous key version

---

### User Story 3 - DEK Generation and Context Binding (Priority: P1)

A security architect needs Data Encryption Keys (DEK) to be generated securely and bound to the token's service context. Each session (containing access and refresh tokens) should use a single fresh DEK generated with cryptographically secure randomness, with the service_id context cryptographically bound during DEK encryption. DEKs should be unique per session and tightly coupled with their encrypted tokens and service context. All tokens within a session (access_token and refresh_token) share the same DEK, optimized for a single KMS wrap operation.

**Why this priority**: DEK security and context binding are crucial for envelope encryption. Generating fresh, random DEKs per session with context binding ensures that tokens cannot be reused in different contexts, and compromise of one session's DEK doesn't affect other sessions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by encrypting multiple sessions with different contexts, verifying that each session has a unique DEK, and confirming that tokens encrypted in one context cannot be decrypted with different context values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple sessions are encrypted with different contexts, **When** each session is created, **Then** a fresh DEK is generated for the session with cryptographically secure randomness, and the context is bound to the DEK encryption
2. **Given** two sessions with different contexts (principal/service/session_id), **When** both are stored, **Then** each session has a unique DEK with its context bound, and attempting to decrypt one session's DEK with another's context fails
3. **Given** DEKs are generated for session encryption, **When** all operations complete, **Then** DEKs used for encryption are securely erased from memory and never appear in logs

---

### User Story 4 - Environment Variable KEK Injection for Development (Priority: P1)

A developer in a local development or test environment needs to inject KEK material via environment variables without requiring cloud key management services. This enables full-stack development in containers, local machines, and CI/CD environments using simple environment variable configuration.

**Why this priority**: Supporting environment variable KEK injection is essential for development flexibility. Developers and test environments cannot always access AWS services, so environment variable support via existing `${env_var}` interpolation enables full-stack development without cloud dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting ENCRYPTION_KEK environment variable, configuring `encryption.key_encryption_key: ${ENCRYPTION_KEK}`, encrypting/decrypting tokens with context, and verifying tokens persist correctly across application restarts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the encryption configuration is set to `encryption.key_encryption_key: ${ENCRYPTION_KEK}` and ENCRYPTION_KEK environment variable is set before application startup, **When** the application starts, **Then** KEK material is loaded from the environment variable via interpolation
2. **Given** KEK material is provided via environment variable, **When** tokens are encrypted and decrypted, **Then** the environment variable KEK is used correctly for both DEK wrapping and unwrapping
3. **Given** a token is encrypted and decrypted with environment variable KEK and context, **When** the application restarts with the same ENCRYPTION_KEK value, **Then** the same KEK can still decrypt previously encrypted tokens with the same context

---

### User Story 5 - Transparent Token Encryption/Decryption in Repository (Priority: P1)

A developer using the session repository needs token envelope encryption to be transparent and automatic. When storing sessions with tokens and their context, DEK generation and encryption should happen automatically without manual intervention. When retrieving sessions, DEK unwrapping and token decryption should happen automatically with context verification.

**Why this priority**: Transparency is critical for developer experience. The encryption vault should be integrated into the session repository so developers don't need to think about encryption/decryption at the application level.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling the repository's `Create` and `Get` methods with context data, verifying that tokens are encrypted with envelope encryption, and that the returned session has plaintext tokens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a session with tokens and service_id context is passed to the repository's `Create` method, **When** the session is stored, **Then** tokens are encrypted using envelope encryption with service_id context binding and plaintext tokens are not stored
2. **Given** a session is retrieved with the repository's `Get` method, **When** the session is returned, **Then** tokens are automatically decrypted using envelope encryption with context verification and available as plaintext
3. **Given** the session repository is used normally, **When** envelope encryption/decryption happens, **Then** no manual encryption steps are required by calling code

---

### User Story 6 - Multi-Service Isolation via Encryption Context (Priority: P2)

A platform operator managing multiple OAuth2 services (GitHub, Google, custom OAuth providers) needs tokens from different services to be isolated at the cryptographic level: tokens encrypted for service A cannot be used for service B, preventing cross-service token reuse attacks even if an attacker compromises the database and gains direct read access to encrypted tokens and wrapped DEKs.

**Why this priority**: Multi-service isolation validates that core envelope encryption (US1) prevents high-level cross-service attacks. US1 enforces context verification at DEK/KEK layers; US6 validates this mechanism prevents practical attack scenarios. P2 because context verification is mandatory (US1), but testing it across multiple services is validation/integration work.

**Dependencies**: Depends on User Story 1 (Envelope Encryption) for the context verification mechanism.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating sessions for multiple services, extracting encrypted ciphertexts from the database, and verifying ciphertext from service A cannot be decrypted in service B's context through any attack vector.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application managing sessions for services "oauth2", "github", and "google", **When** sessions are created for each service with unique tokens and encryption context, **Then** each session has a unique DEK wrapped with its own service_id context (no shared DEK across services)
2. **Given** ciphertext from service "oauth2" stored in database, **When** decryption is attempted with service_id "github", **Then** decryption fails at both DEK verification layer (AAD mismatch) AND KEK unwrap layer (context mismatch), preventing cross-service reuse
3. **Given** an attacker with database access extracts encrypted tokens and wrapped DEKs from service "oauth2" and attempts to decrypt them as service "github" tokens, **When** they call the application's decryption endpoint with wrong service_id context, **Then** both cryptographic layers reject the ciphertext with ErrorKindContextMismatch, and the attack is prevented with clear audit log entry

---

### User Story 7 - Post-Quantum Cryptography Readiness (Priority: P3)

A forward-thinking security team wants the encryption vault to support post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for both DEK and KEK when available. This future-proofs token encryption against potential quantum computing threats.

**Why this priority**: Post-quantum cryptography is future-oriented. While quantum threats are not immediate, supporting PQC algorithms now ensures long-term protection of tokens. This can be deferred to follow-up work if needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by enabling post-quantum cryptography, encrypting tokens with post-quantum algorithms, and verifying encryption/decryption work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** post-quantum cryptography is available and enabled, **When** tokens are encrypted with envelope encryption, **Then** both DEK encryption and KEK wrapping use post-quantum algorithms
2. **Given** tokens encrypted with post-quantum envelope encryption, **When** decryption is performed, **Then** decryption succeeds without requiring special algorithm handling
3. **Given** systems without post-quantum cryptography support, **When** the system runs with PQC disabled, **Then** tokens are encrypted with classical algorithms without errors

---

### User Story 8 - Edge Cases & Error Handling (Priority: P1)

A reliability engineer needs the system to handle edge cases gracefully: large tokens that exceed encryption buffer limits, DEK generation failures, KEK unavailability during decryption, and context mismatch scenarios. Errors must fail fast and clearly rather than silently corrupting data or causing data loss.

**Why this priority**: Error handling is critical for production stability. Edge cases must fail fast with clear error messages to operators.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating each edge case and verifying application responses are safe, predictable, and fail-closed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a token larger than 1MB (boundary test), **When** encryption is attempted, **Then** encryption fails with ErrorKindEncryptionFailed and error message includes max buffer size (no silent truncation)
2. **Given** DEK generation fails (e.g., insufficient randomness from OS), **When** session creation is attempted, **Then** application fails with ErrorKindEncryptionFailed and no session is created (fail-closed)
3. **Given** AWS KMS becomes unavailable during token decryption (network failure, service down), **When** GetSession is called, **Then** application fails with ErrorKindKEKUnavailable after AWS SDK timeout (default 10s) with clear error message for operator
4. **Given** encryption context (service_id) mismatches between encryption and decryption, **When** token decryption is attempted, **Then** failure occurs at both DEK verification AND KEK unwrap layers with ErrorKindContextMismatch error
5. **Given** ciphertext is tampered (bytes corrupted due to storage fault), **When** decryption is attempted, **Then** AESGCMSIV authentication tag verification fails with ErrorKindIntegrityViolation (no silent data corruption)
6. **Given** plaintext token is nil or empty, **When** encryption is attempted, **Then** encryption succeeds (empty tokens are valid; edge case handled correctly)

### Domain Model

**Entities** (things with unique identity):

- **EncryptedOAuthToken**: Represents an encrypted OAuth token with metadata: encrypted token data (ciphertext), wrapped DEK, encryption context, token type, algorithm identifier, timestamp
- **EncryptionConfig**: Represents envelope encryption configuration: KEK backend type, backend-specific parameters

**Aggregates** (consistency boundaries):

- **UserSession** (existing): Aggregate root extended to support envelope encryption. Storage adapters handle transparent encryption/decryption via EncryptionPort, with DEK generation, context binding, and KEK wrapping managed by the encryption adapter.

**Value Objects** (things without identity):

- **EncryptionContext**: Map containing exactly one field: service_id (OAuth service identifier). Immutable and bound to both DEK encryption and KEK wrapping as authenticated additional data (AAD). Optimizes key management operations while providing service-level separation of encrypted tokens.
- **WrappedEnvelope**: Represents the complete encrypted output: token ciphertext with DEK context verification, wrapped (encrypted) DEK with KEK context verification, and authentication metadata

**Domain Events** (state changes of business significance):

- **TokenEncrypted**: OAuth token encrypted with envelope encryption and context binding, ready for storage
- **TokenDecrypted**: OAuth token decrypted from envelope with context verified, ready for use
- **TokenEncryptionFailed**: Envelope encryption failed (DEK generation, context binding, or KEK wrapping); session storage should be rejected
- **TokenDecryptionFailed**: Envelope decryption failed (context verification or DEK unwrapping or token decryption); session retrieval should fail securely
- **ContextVerificationFailed**: Encryption context verification failed during encryption or decryption, indicating context mismatch or tampering

### Configuration Requirements

**Configuration Parameters**:

The system uses a single unified configuration parameter that supports both AWS KMS and environment variable KEK storage via the existing `${env_var}` interpolation:

- **`encryption.key_encryption_key`**: Single field accepting either an AWS KMS ARN or `${ENCRYPTION_KEK}` for environment variable interpolation
  - **AWS KMS (production)**: `arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id` or `arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:alias/alias-name`
  - **Environment variable (development/containers)**: `${ENCRYPTION_KEK}` - resolves to the ENCRYPTION_KEK environment variable at runtime

The system automatically detects the KEK type by checking if the value is an AWS KMS ARN or an environment variable reference, and configures the appropriate AWS Encryption SDK keyring accordingly.

**Configuration Location**: Encryption configuration is integrated into the existing `.env` configuration approach from feature 002-flexible-configuration, leveraging the platform's native `${env_var}` interpolation support.

- **SR-008**: Encryption MUST prevent chosen-ciphertext attacks through authenticated encryption (AESGCMSIV authentication tag)
- **SR-009**: Post-quantum cryptography support via Go 1.24+ and AWS Encryption SDK MUST be available for future deployment

#### Key Management Requirements

- **SR-010**: KEK MUST be securely stored following industry best practices: AWS KMS for production or environment variable injection for development/containers
- **SR-011**: KEK MUST support key rotation with backward compatibility—tokens encrypted with previous KEK versions MUST remain decryptable after rotation
- **SR-012**: KEK MUST NEVER exist in plaintext in application memory during normal operation (only in use for wrapping/unwrapping operations)
- **SR-013**: KEK MUST NEVER be stored in plaintext in logs, configuration files (beyond `${ENCRYPTION_KEK}` variable reference), or debug output
- **SR-014**: AWS KMS key operations (when configured) MUST support audit logging of all KEK operations (wrapping and unwrapping) via AWS CloudTrail
- **SR-015**: Environment variable KEK injection (when configured) MUST NOT expose the KEK in error logs, stack traces, or application logs; AWS Encryption SDK MUST handle KEK securely from environment
- **SR-016**: System MUST validate KEK accessibility at startup and fail fast if KEK cannot be accessed

#### Buffer and Memory Requirements

- **SR-017**: Plaintext OAuth tokens MUST be zeroed from memory after use via secure buffer handling using memguard library (defer statements with secure cleanup)
- **SR-018**: DEK material MUST be zeroed from memory after use (after DEK wrapping during encryption, after DEK unwrapping during decryption) using memguard
- **SR-019**: Plaintext DEK MUST NOT persist in memory across multiple operations (single-use temporary buffers)
- **SR-020**: KEK and DEK material MUST be protected against swapping to disk (memory locking via memguard) when possible
- **SR-021**: Core dumps MUST NOT contain plaintext KEK or DEK material (core dump exclusion via memguard)
- **SR-022**: All sensitive buffers (plaintext tokens, DEK, KEK) MUST be handled with memguard library providing secure cleanup, memory locking, and core dump exclusion

#### Operational Security Requirements

- **SR-030**: All DEK and KEK operations MUST include context verification (service_id) as integral part of cryptographic operations
- **SR-031**: If AWS KMS becomes unavailable during token decryption, delegate to AWS SDK retry behavior. If AWS SDK retries exhaust, fail the operation with SDK error. No custom retry logic. Total p99 latency target: <300ms (50ms local ops + 250ms KMS buffer).
- **SR-032**: Key rotation is supported via AWS KMS native key versioning for production deployments. Environment variable KEK (development-only) does not support rotation—old tokens become unrecoverable on KEK change; this is acceptable for ephemeral dev environments.

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: Local encrypt/decrypt operations (DEK generation, wrapping, memguard buffer cleanup) SHOULD complete in under 50ms, excluding AWS KMS latency. AWS KMS latency is variable (typically 50-200ms per AWS SLA ~99.99%). Target total p99 latency: <300ms (50ms local + 250ms KMS buffer)
- **PR-002**: Decryption of a typical session (both access and refresh tokens) using envelope encryption with context verification and local operations SHOULD complete in under 50ms, excluding KMS unwrap latency
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle encryption and decryption operations without blocking the session repository under normal load
- **PR-004**: KMS latency variability is an operator/deployment concern; local performance targets assume KMS availability within AWS SLA

### Key Entities

- **EncryptedOAuthToken**: Encapsulates encrypted token envelope with wrapped DEK and service_id context
- **EncryptionConfig**: Manages KEK storage backend configuration
- **EncryptionPort**: Interface for envelope encryption/decryption, implemented by AWS SDK adapter

- Session repository from feature 005-session-management is available and can be extended with envelope encryption
- memguard library is available for memory protection (buffer zeroing, memory locking, core dump exclusion)
- Operators manage KEKs (AWS KMS keys or environment variables) according to organizational security policies and best practices

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-01-15

- Q: Should OAuthTokenVault aggregate exist or should storage adapters call EncryptionPort directly? → A: Remove OAuthTokenVault, storage adapters call EncryptionPort directly
- Q: Pre-commit to AWS Encryption SDK algorithms or keep algorithm-agnostic? → A: Pre-commit to AWS Encryption SDK (AESGCMSIV)
- Q: Is backward compatibility across KEK key rotations required? → A: Yes, support backward compatibility with old KEK versions
- Q: Mandate memguard library for memory protection or remain agnostic? → A: Mandate memguard library
- Q: EncryptionContext fields optimization? → A: Reduce to service_id only (removes redundancy with principal, session_id, purpose)
- Q: Configuration design for KEK storage (separate backends vs. unified field)? → A: Single `encryption.key_encryption_key` field with `${env_var}` interpolation (leverages existing config system, AWS KMS ARN for production or `${ENCRYPTION_KEK}` for development)
- Q: Update all context references from 4-field to service_id only for consistency? → A: Yes, update all user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria to reflect service_id-only context

### Session 2026-01-16

- Q: Runtime KMS Failure Handling → A: Delegate to AWS SDK retry behavior. If KMS becomes unavailable during token decryption, the AWS SDK will handle transient retries according to its configured policy. If retries exhaust, the operation fails with the SDK error. No custom retry logic needed.
- Q: DEK-Per-Session Trade-off → A: One DEK per session. Sessions contain only access_token and refresh_token (no id_token). Both tokens share one DEK per session, optimized to single KMS call per session wrap operation.
- Q: Observability & Audit Logging Format → A: Use structured JSON logging following existing project logging patterns. Canonical fields: operation, service_id, success, token_type, timestamp, error_kind. No plaintext tokens or keys. Align with current agentic-identity-broker logging conventions.
- Q: Backward Compatibility Scope for KEK Rotation → A: AWS KMS handles rotation natively with key versioning. Environment variable KEK (development-only) does not require rotation support; production must use AWS KMS for key rotation and backward compatibility.
- Q: Performance Target Interpretation → A: Separate performance budgets. Local encrypt/decrypt ops (DEK generation, wrapping, memguard): <50ms. KMS latency: variable (AWS SLA ~99.99%). Total p99 latency goal: <300ms. KMS latency is operator/deployment concern.
- Q: Should EncryptionPort accept memguard.Enclave for early plaintext protection? → A: Defer architectural change to future spec refinement. Keep current EncryptionPort interface accepting []byte. This decision impacts abstraction boundaries and warrants dedicated architectural review post-Phase-4 acceptance tests. Current implementation prioritizes feature completion with planned hardening in Phase 11 (Polish & Hardening).

## Notes

This specification uses **Envelope Encryption** with two key layers and context binding at the DEK level: Data Encryption Keys (DEK) that encrypt individual tokens with encryption context (service_id) as authenticated additional data, and Key Encryption Keys (KEK) that wrap (encrypt) the DEKs with the same context as authenticated additional data. Each token encryption generates a fresh, random DEK, binds service_id context during encryption, and the DEK is wrapped by the KEK with context verification. Context verification happens at both layers: DEK decryption verifies context, and DEK unwrapping verifies context. Mismatch at either layer causes decryption to fail immediately.

The KEK is securely stored following industry best practices: externalized in a centralized key management service (for production) with audit logging and access controls, or locally with restricted file permissions (for development). The system explicitly forbids plaintext fallback and requires fail-closed behavior if KEK access or context verification fails at any point. KEK key rotation is supported with backward compatibility—tokens encrypted with previous KEK versions remain decryptable after rotation.

Encryption context consists of a single field: service_id (OAuth service identifier). This field binds each token to its service, providing defense-in-depth separation across services and optimizing key management operations. Memory protection uses the memguard library to protect plaintext tokens, DEKs, and KEKs through secure buffer handling, memory locking, and core dump exclusion.

Implementation uses AWS Encryption SDK with AESGCMSIV (Encrypt-then-MAC with counter mode) for authenticated encryption, providing battle-tested cryptographic implementation and future post-quantum cryptography support via Go 1.24+.
