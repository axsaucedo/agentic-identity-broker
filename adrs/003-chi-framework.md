# ADR 003: Chi Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: 003-dual-port-server

## Context

The dual-port HTTP server feature requires an HTTP routing framework to handle request routing, middleware composition, and HTTP server lifecycle. We need a framework that is lightweight, idiomatic Go, and compatible with the standard library's `net/http` package.

## Decision

We will use **chi v5** (`github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`) as the HTTP routing framework for both the end-user and admin servers.

## Rationale

### Advantages of chi v5

1. **Stdlib Compatible**: Built entirely on `net/http`, no custom server implementation
2. **Lightweight**: ~1000 lines of code, minimal abstraction, no hidden magic
3. **Idiomatic Go**: Follows Go idioms and patterns, aligns with project's Go-first approach
4. **Context-Based**: Native support for `context.Context` for request scoping, timeouts, and cancellation
5. **Middleware Support**: Clean middleware chain composition for logging, recovery, and metrics
6. **Production Proven**: Used by many Go projects, stable API, good maintenance
7. **Zero External Dependencies**: chi itself has no dependencies beyond Go stdlib

### Alternatives Considered

1. **gorilla/mux**: Heavier framework with more features than needed, larger API surface
2. **gin**: Fast but opinionated, uses custom context type which breaks stdlib compatibility
3. **echo**: Similar to gin, custom context, more framework-like than needed
4. **stdlib only (net/http)**: Would require manual routing logic and reinventing middleware patterns
5. **fiber**: Built on fasthttp (not net/http), incompatible with stdlib patterns

## Consequences

### Positive

- Idiomatic Go code that's easy to understand and maintain
- Full compatibility with standard library HTTP testing tools
- Minimal learning curve for developers familiar with `net/http`
- Clean separation between routing logic and business logic
- Excellent performance characteristics

### Negative

- Less feature-rich than larger frameworks (but we don't need those features)
- No built-in validation or binding (but we use manual validation per constitution)
- Smaller ecosystem than gin/echo (but sufficient for our needs)

## Implementation Notes

- Use chi.Router for both end-user and admin servers
- Each server has its own independent router instance
- Standard middleware: logging, recovery (panic handling)
- Health endpoint registered explicitly as GET /health
