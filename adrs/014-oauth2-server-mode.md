# ADR 014: OAuth2 Server Mode — Fosite Headless Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The identity broker needs a local token minting mode (`issue_token`) to operate as a standalone OAuth2 authorization server, issuing its own JWT access tokens. This requires implementing:
- Client credentials and authorization code (with PKCE) grant types
- JWT signing with managed asymmetric keys (ES256, RS256)
- RFC 8414 discovery and JWKS endpoints
- Client authentication with Argon2id-hashed secrets

Two approaches were evaluated:
1. **Custom implementation**: Build OAuth2 protocol handling from scratch (~510 LOC)
2. **Fosite headless integration**: Use ory/fosite's protocol handler layer without its HTTP transport

## Decision

Use **ory/fosite as a headless domain library**. Only the handler layer is used:
- `AuthorizeExplicitGrantHandler` for authorization code flow
- `ClientCredentialsGrantHandler` for client credentials grant
- `pkce.Handler` for PKCE enforcement

These handlers operate on clean interfaces (`fosite.AuthorizeRequester`, `fosite.AccessRequester`) with no `*http.Request` dependency.

### Strategy Implementations

Custom strategies replace fosite's default implementations:
- **JWXAccessTokenStrategy**: JWT signing via `lestrrat-go/jwx/v3` with encrypted key material
- **RandomCodeStrategy**: Authorization code generation via `crypto/rand` (32 bytes, base64url)

### Type Containment Rules

All fosite types are contained within `internal/domain/oauth2server/`. They never appear in:
- `internal/ports/` (port interfaces use project-native types)
- `internal/adapters/http/` (handlers use `ports.TokenMintingStrategy` and `ports.AuthorizationCodeIssuer`)
- `internal/app/` (builder wires strategies, not fosite types)

### Integration Pattern

The existing `OAuth2Service` returns a mode-agnostic `"proceed"` action when consent is satisfied. In proxy mode, the HTTP handler redirects to the upstream server. In issue_token mode, the handler delegates to `AuthorizationCodeIssuer` to issue a local code.

### Custom-Implementation Fallback Plan

If fosite v0.x instability becomes a problem, the fallback is a custom implementation:
- Replace fosite handlers with direct protocol logic (~510 LOC)
- Keep the same strategy interfaces (JWXAccessTokenStrategy, RandomCodeStrategy)
- No changes to ports, HTTP handlers, or builder wiring
- Contained entirely within `internal/domain/oauth2server/`

## Consequences

### Positive
- Battle-tested PKCE enforcement (8+ edge cases handled by fosite)
- Authorization code replay detection via fosite's storage contract
- Scope validation with established patterns
- ~510 LOC of protocol logic not maintained by the project

### Negative
- Dependency on fosite v0.x (pre-1.0)
- Fosite's `fosite.Config` struct requires careful configuration
- Type containment discipline required (enforced by code review and import rules)

### Neutral
- Custom strategies (JWX, RandomCode) are the same effort regardless of fosite vs custom
- Client authentication (Argon2id) is outside fosite — implemented in `ClientAuthService`
